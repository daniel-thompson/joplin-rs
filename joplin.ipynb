Currently the user selected kbuild setting is\\nignored and the PL01X's DEBUG_LL stub is silently selected instead. This\\nis a pain if your hardware doesn't have this cell, not least because it\\ntakes a little time to figure out that kbuild built the wrong code.\\n\\nWarning:\\n\\n    silentoldconfig on PL011 single platforms will result in DEBUG_LL\\n    being directed at ICEDCC rather than PL011. This should only\\n    affect silentoldconfig since oldconfig prompts and the defconfigs have\\n    been updated to avoid this problem.\\n\\nChanges sine v14:\\n- Spell cns3xxx (was cnx3xxxx) correctly in the patch subject (Baruch\\n  Siach)\\n\\nChanges since v13:\\n- Rebased on 3.19-rc1 and dropped my patch for SA1100 which is\\n  obsoleted by commit e6131fa38354 (\\\"ARM: debug: move StrongARM debug\\n  include to arch/arm/include/debug\\\") \\n\\nChanges since v12:\\n- v11 spuriously missed out changes from v10 and v11 (it was incorrectly\\n  derived from v9). All changes have been reinstated after thorough\\n  review of the diff between v13 and v11 (many thanks to Aaro Koskinen).\\n- Merged the changes to 8250 related changes to defconfig files into\\n  a single patch (Arnd Bergmann).\\n\\nChanges since v11:\\n- Fixed sort order of Kconfig symbols (review of Russell King)\\n- Reviewed all defconfigs for the selection of DEBUG_UART_NONE.  All\\n  identified have 8250-based UARTs and are switched to DEBUG_LL_UART_8250\\n  (review of Arnd Bergmann).\\n- Fixed regression in the netx macros (bad setting of \\\\rp and \\\\rv.\\n- Rebased on latest mainline (v3.18-rc1). Note that two patches from v11\\n  were merged upstream and are no longer included here.\\n- Added a trivial fix to the defaults list for DEBUG_UART_PHYS which came\\n  to my attention as a merge conflict.\\n\\nChanges since v10:\\n- Fixed typos in the omap1 config help texts (review of Aaro Koskinen).\\n\\nChanges since v9:\\n- Removed a spuriously introduced (and unused) config variable from\\n  the netx patch (review of Paul Bolle).\\n- Fix netx macro to ensure \\\\rv is correctly initialized.\\n- Rebased on v3.17rc4.\\n\\nChanges since v8:\\n- Regenerated patch series with --find-renames to properly track code\\n  movement.\\n\\nChanges since v7:\\n- Killed DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE completely and migrated over the four remaining\\n  platforms that relied on this (Arnd Bergmann, Russell King). This\\n  fixes some problems with oldconfig builds.\\n- Rebased on latest mainline (v3.17rc1).\\n\\nChanges since v6:\\n- Removed a patch to limit DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE to platforms that support\\n  it because it almost time to drop DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE anyway (only\\n  four platforms still use it).\\n- Rebased on latest mainline (v3.16rc3).\\n\\nChanges since v5:\\n\\n- Shortened the list of platforms that can select DEBUG_LL_UART_NONE\\n  (changes Arnd Bergmann)\\n- Rebased on latest mainline (v3.15rc7).\\n\\nChanges since v4:\\n\\n- Rebased to latest mainline (and tested again).

Xenomai 2\\nwas *very* strongly influences by this, to the point of having the RTOS\\npersonality mostly implemented by kernel modules.\\n\\nXenomai 3 largely splits the RT extensions (cobalt) from the RTOS\\ncompatibility logic. The RTOS APIs are not presented by wrapper layers\\nthat can target either mecury (implemented with native Linux interfaces)\\nor cobalt.\\n\\n# Cobalt\\n\\nCobalt is the co-kernel that provides RT extensions for Xenomai.\\n\\nKey concept is that each Cobalt thread shadows a Linux thread meaning\\nthe thread can transition to/from RT and non-RT scheduling. A cobalt\\nthread will transition to not-RT mode on a Linux system call, faults \\nand signal delivery. This provides cobalt thread access to native linux \\nfeatures (drivers, filesystems, maybe network) during initialization and\\ntear down. However once things are running the thread must avoid these\\nthings.\\n\\nThe concept is also extended to the driver framework. It can rely on the\\ninit/teardown logic and bus management.\\n\\nThere are obvious parallels with here with best-practice native Linux real\\ntime code w.r.t. memory pinning and deferring I/O to SCHED_OTHER\\nthreads. The set of safe calls is much smaller but, because using an\\nunsafe call provokes a transition from cobalt -> native linux\\nscheduling, accidentally calling unsafe code is easily identified and\\ndebugged.\\n\\n# Cobalt library\\n\\nTo access cobalt from userspace there is a library that provides a\\nsecond implementation of the POSIX RT API. To avoid conflicts with the\\nlibc API all the cobalt library symbols are prefixed __wrapped_ and\\nrelies on a special build system to access the right set of symbols.\\n\\nTODO: Sounds like the rough edge is the dual implementation of the POSIX\\n      API. Next step looks to me like making POSIX primatives (especially\\n      ) condition\\n      variables\\n\" }\n",

The mba will be\\nvalidated by the MSS boot rom and if successful enter a state of waiting\\nfor the actual modem firmware. The modem firmware is loaded by the\\nkernel, TrustZone is invoked to shift the access control to only allow\\nMSS to access it and the MBA is informed and the modem is booting. This\\nis implemented in drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_mss.c\\n\\nAt this point the modem will communicate with qrtr-ns [1] and a handful\\nof services will appear in qrtr-lookup. The modem firmware will look for\\nservice id 14 \\\"Remove File System service\\\".\\n\\nService 14 is a set of QMI messages for the purpose of opening files\\nrelated to the modem's persistent storage and performing read and writes\\nto these files. A chunk of shared memory is used in order to communicate\\nthe actual data, this memory is controlled by\\ndrivers/soc/qcom/rmtfs_mem.c and the service itself is implemented by\\nrmtfs [2].\\n\\nOnce this is done initialization of the modem firmware continues and\\ndozens of services will appear on node 0.\\n\\nIf the modem is unable to find or communicate with rmtfs during it's\\ninitialization phase it will enter a failure mode and after 40 seconds a\\n\\\"boot watchdog\\\" will kick in and cause an fatal error, seen by\\nremoteproc and a restart of the MSS will be attempted by remoteproc.\\n\\n\\n# TFTP\\nAs the modem learns from the pd-mapper [3] that it's supposed to\\ndownload the WLAN firmware it will look for the TFTP QRTR service with\\nid 4096.  An implementation of this can be found at [4].\\n\\nThe modem will first issue write operations against files in the\\ndirectory /readwrite, so this must exist and be writable. And will after\\nthat attempt to download the file /readonly/firmware/image/wlanmdsp.mbn\\n\\nThe wlanmdsp.mbn is a normal mbn file, which means that it's signed by\\na vendor specific key, so this file must come from the right vendor (and\\npossibly right product).\\n\\nIn Windows this file can be found in FileRepository\\\\qcwlan_wd856.inf*\\\\\\nsomewhere under the Windows directory.\\n\\nOnce this file is downloaded to the modem service 0x45 will be\\nregistered with QRTR on the modem node. This will trigger the\\nath10k_snoc kernel module to start initializing ath10k.\\n\\n\\n# Ath10k firmware files\\nIn addition to loading the actual WiFi firmware two data files are\\nrequired as well: firmware-5.bin and board-2.bin.\\n\\nA version of firmware-5.bin that should match the firmware we have\\npretty well can be found in [5].\\n\\nThere's board-2.bin files available in the ath10k-firmware as well, but\\nso far I've not found a product where the driver is satisfied with the\\ncontent of that, so we need to generate this from the Qualcomm releases.\\n\\n\\n# Creating board-2.bin\\nThe board-2.bin file contains some sort of device specific information,\\nbut comes out of qualcomm as a series of bdwlan.* files. So these needs\\nto be repacked.\\n\\nFor this we need the \\\"QCA Swiss Army Knife\\\" [6] and a (derivative of a)\\nscript that I found in a Cheza commit message [7]. In an empty directory\\ncopy all the bdwlan.* files into a subdirectory called \\\"bdf\\\".\\n\\nThen run [7] with no arguments.\\n\\nThe script will download the swiss army knife, create a json file\\ndescribing all the bwwlan.* files and combine them all into a file named\\nboard-2.bin in the current directory.\\n\\nCopy the board-2.bin to the suitable folder under /lib/firmware/ath10k.\\n\\n\\nPending patches\\n===============\\nAs of v5.3-rc1 it seems that the only patches missing are the following\\ntwo (and a random set of defconfig updates):\\n\\nath10k: Fix HOST capability QMI incompatibility\\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190725063108.15790-1-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/\\nFirmware used in SDM845 has a different definition of the HOST\\ncompatibility QMI message than QCS404, so the prior broke with the\\nintroduction of the latter.

Qualcomm is trying to upstream a new SMD driver (totally different with the one used current)\\n[14:11:35] Yin Fengwei: This is background.\\n[14:11:55] danielthompson-rfn: SMD -> shared memory device?\\n[14:12:05] danielthompson-rfn: A piece of QCOM specific h/ware?\\n[14:12:07] Yin Fengwei: For wifi/BT, they both use SMD. And in 4.0 kernel, Nico's plan is to stick to current SMD driver.\\n[14:12:07] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:12:35] Yin Fengwei: Yes. It's shared memomry device which could be used to exchange data/cmd/info between several IP/core.\\n[14:12:59] danielthompson-rfn: and TTY?\\n[14:13:04] Yin Fengwei: But the target is actully the new SMD driver (which is Qualcomm guy trying to upstream).\\n[14:13:15] Yin Fengwei: Yes. BT is based on SMD TTY.\\n[14:13:27] Yin Fengwei: It's TTY serial driver based on SMD.\\n[14:13:35] danielthompson-rfn: Ok.\\n[14:13:56] Yin Fengwei: BT functionaliy is on wcnss core which exhange the data with CPU by using SMD.\\n[14:14:46] Yin Fengwei: So the description should be: Prepare updating wcn3620 and SMD TTY to the new SMD driver which Qualcomm is trying to upstream.\\n[14:14:47] danielthompson-rfn: So \\\"Port WNC3620 Bluetooth driver to to new Shared Memory Device (SMD)\\r\\ndriver currently being upstreamed by Qualcomm engineers.\\\"\\n[14:14:53] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:15:01] Yin Fengwei: Yours are better.\\n[14:15:03] danielthompson-rfn: Or is is SMD *framework*\\n[14:15:08] danielthompson-rfn: (rather than driver)\\n[14:15:10] Yin Fengwei: I am not native Eng.\\n[14:15:19] Yin Fengwei: It's a driver.\\n[14:15:30] Yin Fengwei: Not a framework per my understanding.\\n[14:15:56] danielthompson-rfn: Ok (don't worry about not native Eng, many many people speak English much better than me)\\n[14:16:15] danielthompson-rfn: Are any changes to wireless driver needed for new SMD?\\n[14:16:25] Yin Fengwei: It's complicated driver.\\n[14:16:36] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:16:58] Yin Fengwei: wireless driver use SMD to exchange data/cmd with wcnss core.\\n[14:17:11] danielthompson-rfn: So \\\"Port WNC3620 WiFi and Bluetooth drivers to to new Shared Memory Device (SMD) driver currently being upstreamed by Qualcomm engineers.\\\"?\\n[14:17:28] Yin Fengwei: So if qualcomm has new SMD driver upstream, wifi driver need to follow the new SMD API.\\n[14:17:38] danielthompson-rfn: That makes sense.\\n[14:17:40] Yin Fengwei: Bluetoot TTY driver.\\n[14:17:41] danielthompson-rfn: But...\\n[14:17:47] danielthompson-rfn: --> Continue effort to upstream the wcn36xx wireless driver update for wcn3620\\n[14:17:47] Yin Fengwei: Bluetooth\\n[14:17:56] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:18:23] Yin Fengwei: We are trying to upstream wcn3620 support (current mainline kernel just has 3660 and 3680 support).\\n[14:18:32] danielthompson-rfn: Can wireless driver be upstreamed today without SMD changes?\\n[14:18:40] Yin Fengwei: The problem is: the maintainer of wcn36xx is not active.\\n[14:18:50] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:19:43] Yin Fengwei: We split the wireless driver to two parts:\\r\\n1. The one doesn't depened on platform\\r\\n2. The one depends on platform.\\n[14:19:58] Yin Fengwei: SMD part actually depends on platform.\\n[14:20:13] Yin Fengwei: Because some other platform could use USB or SDIO.\\n[14:20:38] Yin Fengwei: We are trying to upstream the part not depend on platform.\\n[14:21:05] danielthompson-rfn: I understand but it will take me a moment to figure out how to write that in monthly report.\\n[14:21:10] Yin Fengwei: The current wcn36xx wifi driver just has the piece not depend on platform.\\n[14:21:30] Yin Fengwei: What about this?\\n[14:22:11] Yin Fengwei: Continue effort to push wcn3620 support to upstream which just support wcn3660 and wcn3680?\\n[14:22:50] danielthompson-rfn: I don't think that is the problem with the current text.\\n[14:23:01] danielthompson-rfn: Its is that fact we are calling *both* pieces by the same name.\\n[14:23:14] danielthompson-rfn: It means we appear to be trying to upstream code we haven't yet ported.\\n[14:23:24] danielthompson-rfn: We need to be able to give the two components different names\\n[14:23:46] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[14:24:26] danielthompson-rfn: Is the following text accurate:\\n[14:24:31] danielthompson-rfn: Continue effort to upstream WCN3620 updates for the WCN36xx wireless\\r\\ndriver core.\\r\\n\\r\\nPort WNC3620 WiFi platform glue and Bluetooth TTY drivers to to new Shared Memory Device (SMD) driver currently being upstreamed by Qualcomm engineers.\\n[14:24:53] Yin Fengwei: That's good.\\n[14:24:57] Yin Fengwei: I like \\\"core\\\" here.\\n[14:25:03] danielthompson-rfn: :-)\\n[14:25:13] danielthompson-rfn: Is \\\"Bluetooth TTY drivers\\\" accurate?\\n[14:25:16] Yin Fengwei: Hope Scott is ok with it.\\n[14:25:29] Yin Fengwei: I suppose Yes.\\n[14:25:31] danielthompson-rfn: Great. I will make those changes.\\n[14:25:41] Yin Fengwei: It's actully TTY driver. But it's used by Bluetooth.\\n[14:26:51] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. I understand.

Things have gone rather quiet.\\n[14:28:36] danielthompson-rfn: However Scott has raised concerns about LCR member builds in general.\\n[14:29:06] danielthompson-rfn: In particular I think the 32-bit member build for Spreadtrum is two months out of date.\\n[14:29:37] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:29:41] danielthompson-rfn: (15.03 rather than 15.05)\\n[14:29:57] danielthompson-rfn: I've been asked to talk to LMG about ideal structure for member build.\\n[14:30:19] danielthompson-rfn: IIRC the main problem we have right now is that we cannot automatically rebase.\\n[14:30:20] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:30:28] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:30:42] danielthompson-rfn: Both Spreadtrum and LCR provide lists of patches and these conflict?\\n[14:31:00] danielthompson-rfn: Are the patches in one git repo or are the Linaro and Spreadtrum patches managed in different repos?\\n[14:31:30] danielthompson-rfn: Put another way: *Why* do we get conflicts here?\\n[14:31:32] Yin Fengwei: Spreadtrum just give us their patches.\\n[14:31:43] Yin Fengwei: They don't give us the conflict information.\\n[14:31:43] danielthompson-rfn: Patches are normally quite resiliant to code changes.\\n[14:32:33] Yin Fengwei: For 32bit member build, there are 2 conflicts in bionic projects. And no other conflicts in other projects.\\n[14:32:51] Yin Fengwei: But both Spreadtrum and lcr change other projects like build system/core\\n[14:32:57] Yin Fengwei: But those patches has no conflict.\\n[14:33:28] danielthompson-rfn: Just to check... the \\\"2 conflicts in bionic\\\" are they what was observed in 15.02 to 15.03?\\n[14:33:39] Yin Fengwei: They changed the same file (but not the same place). Make the patch applying fails.\\n[14:33:48] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:33:54] Yin Fengwei: from 15.02 to 15.03.\\n[14:34:09] danielthompson-rfn: Do you expect it to reoccur in 15.03 to 15.04?\\n[14:34:15] Yin Fengwei: Another one conflict was in browser.\\n[14:34:30] Yin Fengwei: But Spreadtrum and lcr tried to fix the same issue with different implementation.\\n[14:35:15] Yin Fengwei: If we handled that conflict in 15.03, it shouldn't be there if we do 15.03 -> 15.04.\\n[14:35:29] danielthompson-rfn: Good!\\n[14:36:06] danielthompson-rfn: So what would it take to *automate* a merge/rebase of the manifest and let the CI loop tell us automatically when we get conflicts?\\n[14:36:21] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:36:39] Yin Fengwei: Wait.\\n[14:36:50] Yin Fengwei: You mean the manifest merging rebase?\\n[14:37:15] Yin Fengwei: No. Just manifest can't do that.\\n[14:37:16] danielthompson-rfn: Currently Spreadtrum have a local_manifest that is derived from LCR 15.03.\\n[14:37:41] Yin Fengwei: No. That local manifest is derived from AOSP.\\n[14:37:57] Yin Fengwei: The LCR patches was included in that local manifest.\\n[14:38:08] Yin Fengwei: OK. I get you point.\\n[14:38:50] Yin Fengwei: But the LCR is also based on AOSP (AOSP + LCR patch which is manager by lcr local_manifest).\\n[14:39:07] Yin Fengwei: managed by lcr local_manifest\\n[14:39:44] Yin Fengwei: But it's possible we merge the LCR local manifest and Spreadtrum manifest.\\n[14:39:52] danielthompson-rfn: If the Spreadtrum local manifest was (in git) derived from LCR local manifest then it should become possible to merge them.\\n[14:40:22] danielthompson-rfn: Most of the time the merge can be automated and the result sent into the CI loop.\\n[14:40:24] Yin Fengwei: So the process is like following:\\r\\n1. Get AOSP\\r\\n2. Get local manifest (include LCR + Spreadtrum)\\n[14:40:32] Yin Fengwei: 3. Apply the patches.\\n[14:40:39] Yin Fengwei: Yes. That's doable.\\n[14:41:09] Yin Fengwei: Just some twist to the script which is used to apply patches.\\n[14:42:05] Yin Fengwei: I could check with Spreadtrum engineer about this approach.\\n[14:43:11] danielthompson-rfn: Can't it be automated in jenkins (i.e. attempt automatic merge whenever LCR changes)?\\n[14:43:40] Yin Fengwei: I have no idea about the jenkins\\n[14:44:09] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. I think we should open discussion with LMG and Builds/Baselines.\\n[14:44:22] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[14:44:27] danielthompson-rfn: Member builds need to be able to track latest releases.\\n[14:44:30] Yin Fengwei: It better to get the input from LMG.\\n[14:44:52] danielthompson-rfn: Ideally the member that owns the build should only have to worry about it when it breaks... not to have to have routine updates in their diary.\\n[14:45:20] Yin Fengwei: Does this mean: linaro will take care of member build rebase?\\n[14:46:14] danielthompson-rfn: I think we should help with the automation, however it is the members probelm when the build fails.\\n[14:46:26] Yin Fengwei: OK. Get it.\\n[14:47:00] danielthompson-rfn: I'd like to include this activity alongside the establishment on ARM64 builds for Spreadtrum.\\n[14:47:12] danielthompson-rfn: It is our best opportunity to promote this approach.\\n[14:47:25] Yin Fengwei: So the big cycle could be:\\r\\n1. New LCR released.\\r\\n2. Trigger member build automatically rebase to the new LCR.\\r\\n3. If everything is fine, we are done.\\r\\n4. If something break, notify the members.\\n[14:47:33] Yin Fengwei: Agree.\\n[14:47:46] danielthompson-rfn: That's where we'd like to be.\\n[14:47:59] Yin Fengwei: But we need to figure out how to automation in advance.\\n[14:48:08] Yin Fengwei: :)\\n[14:48:13] danielthompson-rfn: Yes. Definitely before we talk to Spreadtrum in detail about it.\\n[14:48:18] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[14:48:37] danielthompson-rfn: For 32-bit build the card to setup CI loop was with Fathi (from Builds/Baselines)\\n[14:49:06] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[14:49:16] Yin Fengwei: Do we have contactor from LMG?\\n[14:50:39] danielthompson-rfn: I planning to ping Tom Gall and ask who to speak to... I suspect he may point us as Vishal but I'm not entirely sure.\\n[14:50:53] danielthompson-rfn: Didn't you work with Vishal whilst setting up?\\n[14:51:09] Yin Fengwei: Just few email.\\n[14:52:09] danielthompson-rfn: Vishal was the engineer assigned to do the work on the CI loop for Spreadtrum: https://cards.linaro.org/browse/DEVPLAT-359\\n[14:53:10] Yin Fengwei: Jam contacted Vishal directly at that time.\\n[14:53:31] Yin Fengwei: I was not involved for member build from the beginning.\\n[14:54:17] Yin Fengwei: There were some issues happenning for member build setup. And I was assigned to help.\\n[14:54:47] danielthompson-rfn: I see.\\n[14:54:58] danielthompson-rfn: It is interesting to note that the manfests for the overnight builds are changing...\\n[14:55:08] danielthompson-rfn: Latest build has different Android patches to when it started.\\n[14:55:20] danielthompson-rfn: https://snapshots.linaro.org/android/~linaro-android-restricted/tshark-android/48\\n[14:55:22] danielthompson-rfn: https://snapshots.linaro.org/android/~linaro-android-restricted/tshark-android/76\\n[14:55:31] danielthompson-rfn: (look at difference in pinned_manifest.xml)\\n[14:55:45] Yin Fengwei: Let me check.\\n[14:56:42] Yin Fengwei: My connection to outside of PRC is like a bitch tonight....\\n[14:56:58] Yin Fengwei: Can't even open Linaro web.\\n[14:57:05] danielthompson-rfn: Perhaps take a look tomorrow then.\\n[14:57:25] Yin Fengwei: Yes. I will check it later.\\n[14:57:34] danielthompson-rfn: I hadn't followed up on this before talking to you but my first impressions are that this is running as it should (and updating latest patches, etc).\\n[14:57:51] danielthompson-rfn: However I have no idea where build output and test output ends up.\\n[14:58:01] danielthompson-rfn: Could you take an action to find out?\\n[14:58:10] Yin Fengwei: Sure.\\n[14:58:15] danielthompson-rfn: Great!\\n[14:58:31] danielthompson-rfn: Is there anything you wanted to raise on your side?\\n[14:58:47] danielthompson-rfn: (I approved your expenses but have to pass them to Scott so I don't see if they come through or not)\\n[14:59:13] Yin Fengwei: The expense are fine. I saw Scott approved it.\\n[14:59:23] danielthompson-rfn: Anything else?\\n[14:59:25] Yin Fengwei: Few update from my side:\\n[14:59:48] Yin Fengwei: US VISA is still ongoing. No idea when I could get it.\\n[15:00:21] danielthompson-rfn: Will you have to go for a face to face interview?\\n[15:01:00] Yin Fengwei: Don't know. I tried not to do that. The last time when I got my US visa, I didn't do face to face.\\n[15:01:18] danielthompson-rfn: Good luck!\\n[15:01:33] Yin Fengwei: I already sent my passport and documents. Just wait the result.\\n[15:01:38] danielthompson-rfn: Ok.\\n[15:01:55] Yin Fengwei: Another thing is: Will we have hikey board?\\n[15:02:41] Yin Fengwei: I mean hikey board for everyone in Linaro.\\n[15:02:51] Yin Fengwei: Or it's not possible?\\n[15:02:59] danielthompson-rfn: You didn't get one at HKG15?\\n[15:03:12] Yin Fengwei: No. I didn't\\n[15:03:39] danielthompson-rfn: Last I heard there were a few left from the first batch.

Now is waiting for Hisilicon's\\n     feedback;\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (KWG-56, PS-72)\\n   - Released ARMv7 patchset (now at v21). No comments yet.\\n   - Re-based existing arm64 proof-of-concept implementation to\\n     simulate NMI, which uses GICv3+ CPU interface to re-implement\\n     irqflags.h, to v4.2-rc1 mainline.\\n   - Extended above patches to use alternatives runtime support to\\n     dynamically patch irqflags.h (support both GICv2 and GICv3 systems).\\n   - Fixed EL1/EL0 IRQ handling to handle NMIs more carefully (i.e.\\n     avoid risk of deadlocks in the generic IRQ handling code).\\n\\n * Linaro: Introduce LTP-DDT to the 96Boards CI loop. [Esla] (PS-56)\\n   - Abandoned attempts (for now) to cross-compile LTP-DDT for debian\\n     and switched native build. Native build is working and, with most\\n     of the test cases disabled, is able to build and run on HiKey.\\n\\n * Qualcomm: WiFi and BT for DragonBoard 410c [Fengwei] (PS-12)\\n   - Had two options to make wifi driver builtin. Both\\n     worked ok. Still discussing with QCOM LT which is preferred solution.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Spreadtrum member build for TSharkT ARM64 board\\n   [Fengwei, Jam] (PS-63)\\n   - Built the Spreadtrum ASOP based release on local workstation. The\\n     images built from this code base could boot on the TSharkT board.\\n\\n * ZTE: Power management training/consultancy [Leo] (PS-62)\\n   - Have refined the slides according to training\\n     summary, mainly for the part of \\\"Power Management Requirement For\\n     ARM CPU\\\". Also refined slides according to Amit's comments.\\n     Answered several minor questions from ZTE side, mainly for waken\\n     up source and big.LITTLE clock/power domains.\\n\\n## Plans\\n\\n * Actions: BSP analysis for Action Semi S900 [Daniel] (PS-52)\\n   - Respond the any questions from Actions Semi (if no questions come\\n     back for two weeks then we can close this card).\\n\\n * Hisilicon: upgrade MCU firmware and stub clock driver [Leo] (PS-30)\\n   - Act on review comments from internal review.\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (KWG-56, PS-72)\\n   - Remove the final few hacks that remain from the proof-of-concept\\n     code and share a new RFC.\\n\\n * Linaro: Introduce LTP-DDT to the 96Boards CI loop.

This allows\\n     us to eliminate cache effects from side-by-side benchmarking of\\n     the two interrupt masking mechanisms.\\n   - Ran micro benchmarks on Hisilicon D02 platform.

But it's released from Qualcomm\\n     as proprietary package. We need to check with Qualcomm whether\\n     they could share us more information so we could try to enable it\\n     for Linux distribution.\\n   - Did more testing: 1  Tried the prima driver with Linux\\n     distribution. Got exactly same     throughput with upstream\\n     driver (wget). 2  Tried wget with Android system. Got exactly\\n     same throughput with     Linux distribution (wget). 3  Tried\\n     iperf with Android system. No surprise here.     Tried wget and\\n     iperf with linux laptop. Got much better throughput     data. So\\n     my wifi environment should be fine. 4  Tried wifi and BT at the\\n     same time with Android. Could see wifi      throughput (wget)\\n     drop just as upstream driver. This is surprise.

Neither upstream nor AOSP branches are sufficient to support\\n    TI products without additional patches.\\n \\n 2. There are very few patches in the AOSP tree that benefit TI.\\n    The majority of the patches either add new drivers or new\\n    test programs.\\n \\n 3. The number of patches needed to support TI products with\\n    mainline libdrm is small. Rebasing the TI branch on the\\n    mainline and attempting to upstream the remaining patches\\n    is a good approach.\\n\\n 4. It is possible to rebase the TI branch on the (more recent)\\n    AOSP fork of libdrm and make that the focus of TI development.\\n    However TI's typical focus on upstream and the minimal changes\\n    currently found in the AOSP fork argues against this.\\n    \\n # Reusing output of analysis activity #\\n\\nAs part of the analysis a rebased tree has already been prepared\\nand this could form the basis of TI upstreaming and product plans based\\non #3 above.\\n\\nWarning: _These branches were originally prepared for the purpose of\\n         analysis only. The rebase has been performed with care\\n\\t but nevertheless these trees have been subject to *absolutely\\n\\t no testing* (not even compile testing) and there are known\\n\\t problems (described in the detailed Patch Review section) with \\n\\t the build system for libkms/omap._\\n\\nGit repo is <https://git.linaro.org/people/daniel.thompson/libdrm.git>,\\nthe branches of interest are:\\n\\n * `hacking/pse28-clean`: This is the `hacking/pse28-rebase` branch with\\n   most of the recommendations in both Patch Review sections below\\n   acted upon. TI patches believed to be spurious have been\\n   removed and AOSP patches believed to be mandatory have been\\n   cherry picked. It currently contains six patches.\\n\\n * `hacking/pse28-rebase`: This branch is a rebase of the TI branch to\\n   mainline and was the basis of the AOSP analysis.\\n\\n * `hacking/aosp-rebase`: This branch is a rebase of the AOSP branch\\n   to the mainline and was the basis of the AOSP analysis. It has no\\n   practical value and is provided FYI only.\\n\\nIf `hacking/pse28-clean` were adopted it would require:\\n\\n 1. Check the changes to libkms. There were extracted from an\\n    \\\"Android\\\" patch and at present neither the autotools nor\\n    Android build systems are aware of `libkms/omap.c`. This file\\n    is also structures very differently from its peers (which do\\n    not require symbols from libdrm). This should also be checked.\\n    \\n 2. Write a new `omap/Android.mk` makefile to ensure omapdrm is\\n    included in the Android build.\\n\\n 3. TI graphics team should review the resulting branch and,\\n    once happy with the review, seek to upstream all patches.\\n\\n # Assumptions\\n\\nThis report makes a couple of assumptions which, if not accepted, may\\nundermine the results.\\n\\n 1. libdrm has not made any maintenance errors with respect to backward\\n    compatibility meaning new versions of the library may be freely\\n    used. This assumption has been partially verified by comparing the\\n    header files found in the ti/marshmallow and origin/master trees.\\n\\n 2. TI have not made private extensions to the kernel ABI that would\\n    impact libdrm upstreaming.\\n\\n # origin/master #\\n\\nFetched from <git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm>.\\n\\nThis is the upstream and we will use this branch as a baseline to\\nidentify unique features found in the two forks.\\n\\nAndroid build support was added in the upstream repository in\\nlate 2014; it does not include omap build support.\\n\\n # ti/marshmallow #\\n\\nFetched from <git://git.ti.com/android-sdk/libdrm.git>.\\n\\nNote: _Within this repo the master and marshmallow branches are\\n      very similar but the marshmallow branch has addition Android.mk \\n      patches compared to the master branch so this report has selected\\n      the marshmallow branch for analysis._\\n\\n## Patches that are already upstream\\n\\nThe following patches are already upstream, either directly or fixed in a\\ndifferent way.\\n\\n * `modetest: add support for modetest`\\n * `drm: Fix error message in drmWaitVBlank`\\n * `gitignore (by Vincent Stehlé)`\\n * `omap: release lock also on error paths`\\n\\n## Conflicting Android build systems\\n\\nThe TI branch adds Android build support, this conflicts with\\nboth the upstream and AOSP branches which has introduced Android\\nbuild support in a significantly different.\\n\\nNeither upstream nor AOSP trees support building omapdrm for Android.  \\nTo adopt one of the other trees, TI should drop all patches related to \\nthe Android build system and add new build files to get omapdrm built.\\n\\nImpacts:\\n\\n * `DRM-KMS: Android support of libdrm`\\n * `DRMKMS: fix the makefile to omapdrm`\\n * `OMAPKMSLIB: Fixed the KMS Lib alloc/free/map`\\n * `android: update makefile to build libdrm as static`\\n\\nNote: _`DRM-KMS: Android support of libdrm` adds significantly more\\n      changes than simply adding Android build support.

It\\nalso makes it safe to call sched_clock() from NMI (or FIQ on ARM).\\n\\nThe data cache profile of sched_clock() in the original code is\\nsomewhere between 2 and 3 (64-byte) cache lines, depending on alignment\\nof struct clock_data. After patching, the cache profile for the normal\\ncase should be a single cacheline.\\n\\nNMI safety was tested on i.MX6 with perf drowning the system in FIQs and\\nusing the perf handler to check that sched_clock() returned monotonic\\nvalues. At the same time I forcefully reduced kt_wrap so that\\nupdate_sched_clock() is being called at >1000Hz.\\n\\nWithout the patches the above system is grossly unstable, surviving\\n[9K,115K,25K] perf event cycles during three separate runs.

And suspected one channel named \\\"diag\\\" is the one to transfer the firmware log from wcnss to AP side.\\n[09:18:32] danielthompson-rfn: Is anyone else working to package adb on dragonboard (Nico said they would have to add adb support at some stage).\\n[09:18:34] Yin Fengwei: Will ask Qualcomm guy once I successfully get firmware log with Android + QXDM.\\n[09:18:45] Yin Fengwei: Nobody as I know.\\n[09:19:07] Yin Fengwei: But adbd is very easy to port I suppose.\\n[09:19:26] danielthompson-rfn: It should be (may take a bit of extra effort to worth with Fathi to get it packaged).\\n[09:19:40] danielthompson-rfn: I'd still prefer to see that done before calling us blocked though.\\n[09:19:44] Yin Fengwei: But adb function driver enabling need ubuntu dump cmd to configfs.\\n[09:20:19] Yin Fengwei: OK. Let me check with Nico who is working on that. If nobody, I could do that.\\n[09:21:01] danielthompson-rfn: Thanks. As you say, I'd be supprised it its a big job.\\n[09:21:08] Yin Fengwei: Again, adb is not critical. We could capture the firmware log and save it on device filesystem.\\n[09:21:19] Yin Fengwei: You mean adb?\\n[09:21:43] danielthompson-rfn: Yes. Let me just check I understand what you say though.\\n[09:22:01] danielthompson-rfn: You think we could just run the daemon and then copy the gathered data by hand to Windows and point the tool at it?\\n[09:22:22] Yin Fengwei: I suppose it's doable.\\n[09:22:50] Yin Fengwei: According to the manual of that tool, there is one mode called without USB connection.\\n[09:23:02] Yin Fengwei: That will save the firmware log to device file system.\\n[09:23:17] Yin Fengwei: I suppose it's an option for ubuntu without adb functionality.\\n[09:23:26] danielthompson-rfn: Makes sense.\\n[09:23:56] Yin Fengwei: So I didn't think adb as blocker here. The daemon thing is.\\n[09:24:11] danielthompson-rfn: I agree however...\\n[09:24:42] danielthompson-rfn: Do you have other worked queued up? Nico has already mentioned this work needs to be done! Perhaps that makes you a candidate to do it anyway?\\n[09:24:52] danielthompson-rfn: (even if its not directly needed)\\n[09:25:39] Yin Fengwei: I know. Now this task is blocked by QXDM tool. Nico is aware of it as well.\\n[09:26:09] danielthompson-rfn: Can we move to other work... we can come back to this in a minute.\\n[09:26:12] Yin Fengwei: So I suppose the only thing we could do for firmware log capture is waiting for echo from Qualcomm.\\n[09:27:08] Yin Fengwei: Yes. Nico assigned a bug from 96board forum to me. Which is related with bad user experience of wcn36xx wifi.\\n[09:27:35] Yin Fengwei: It has very slow (1MB/s) throughput in his side.\\n[09:27:46] Yin Fengwei: I am working on it now.\\n[09:28:00] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. Please ping jason about that... new work... new card.\\n[09:29:17] danielthompson-rfn: Has spreadtrum come back with anything? Is that still blocked on their side?\\n[09:29:19] Yin Fengwei: Sure.\\n[09:29:38] Yin Fengwei: No any response from Spreadtrum side.\\n[09:30:10] Yin Fengwei: Should I ping Spreadtrum again?\\n[09:30:16] danielthompson-rfn: So you're currently low on work due to blockagaes but not idle yet.\\n[09:30:26] Yin Fengwei: My plan was ping them next week.\\n[09:30:30] Yin Fengwei: Yes. Exactly.\\n[09:31:02] Yin Fengwei: Because it takes time to prepare the base code for Android64. I just have talk with them last week.\\n[09:31:28] danielthompson-rfn: I'm happy to go with your instincts on Spreadtrum. Pinging next week is ok for me.\\n[09:31:49] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[09:32:34] Yin Fengwei: That's all update from my side.\\n[09:32:48] Yin Fengwei: Oh. One more thing.\\n[09:33:03] danielthompson-rfn: So... if you manage to get through the throughput bug quickly then ping Nico about whether getting adbd working is a good thing for you to do. Otherwise carry on as you are.\\n[09:33:35] Yin Fengwei: OK. About the throughput bug, I am trying to reproduce it in my side now.\\n[09:33:51] Yin Fengwei: One more thing is: I split the wcn36xx patches to two parts\\n[09:34:18] Yin Fengwei: 1. The enhancement/fixing to current driver.\\r\\n2. The patches to enable dragonboard.\\n[09:34:31] Yin Fengwei: I will send the part 1 to mail list first.\\n[09:34:49] danielthompson-rfn: Good idea. Also ok with me.\\n[09:35:11] Yin Fengwei: One patch was sent to mail list and get Ack-by from Bjorn who is Sony engineer and worked on smd/smsm/BT thing.\\n[09:35:21] Yin Fengwei: OK. I will continue it.\\n[09:35:40] danielthompson-rfn: Thanks for the updates (and sorry about the technical troubles)\\n[09:35:48] Yin Fengwei: :)\\n[09:36:02] Yin Fengwei: OK. That's all update from me.\\n[09:36:06] danielthompson-rfn: Actually, one other thing from me.\\n[09:36:12] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[09:36:21] danielthompson-rfn: Europe moved its timezone back an hour this week...\\n[09:36:49] danielthompson-rfn: Is *this* timeslot ok for you on a Wednesday? (i.e. can I move the weekly meeting back by one hour).\\n[09:36:54] Yin Fengwei: OK. We needs switch the timeslot for the meeting?\\n[09:37:41] Yin Fengwei: I thought Google Calendar could help on that.\\n[09:37:54] Yin Fengwei: Let me double check.\\n[09:39:17] danielthompson-rfn: It will have \\\"jumped\\\" forward an hour because it is anchored in UK TZ\\n[09:39:30] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[09:39:57] Yin Fengwei: So it will be pushed one hour later for our meeting (team meeting and 1:1 meeting). Right?\\n[09:40:08] Yin Fengwei: I didn't see that on my calendar.\\n[09:40:29] danielthompson-rfn: Still working on the 1:1s (I missed Jason this morning and your 1:1 is achored in china TX)\\n[09:40:54] danielthompson-rfn: I think this 1:1 can stay where it is.\\n[09:41:01] Yin Fengwei: But the meeting of Qualcomm landing team is pushed one hour later on the calendar.\\n[09:41:03] Yin Fengwei: Get it.\\n[09:41:12] danielthompson-rfn: Ah...\\n[09:41:21] danielthompson-rfn: I certainly OK to move it forward.\\n[09:41:25] Yin Fengwei: OK. Then PS team meeting needs be adjusted.\\n[09:41:30] Yin Fengwei: Sure.\\n[09:41:38] Yin Fengwei: 1 hour later is fine to me.\\n[09:43:28] Yin Fengwei: What do you think?\\n[09:45:22] Yin Fengwei: Hi Daniel, are you there?\\n[09:45:41] danielthompson-rfn: Am now... you remember I said I was using my phone to connect...\\n[09:45:48] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[09:45:51] Yin Fengwei: I see.\\n[09:45:51] danielthompson-rfn: Well the battery ran out!\\n[09:45:52] danielthompson-rfn: :-(\\n[09:46:01] Yin Fengwei: It happens.\\n[09:46:22] danielthompson-rfn: Just looking a google calendar.\\n[09:46:30] danielthompson-rfn: QCOM LT Meeting is not in your diary.\\n[09:46:59] Yin Fengwei: OK. Let me check.\\n[09:47:55] Yin Fengwei: It's on my Thunderbird Calendar plugin.\\n[09:48:31] danielthompson-rfn: And it is at the same time as the PS meeting after the TZ change in UK?\\n[09:48:46] Yin Fengwei: No.\\n[09:49:09] Yin Fengwei: It's 4 hours later.\\n[09:49:25] danielthompson-rfn: Ah... so you are ok for the new timing of the PS meeting?\\n[09:49:53] Yin Fengwei: You mean one hour later. Right?\\n[09:50:08] danielthompson-rfn: Yes.\\n[09:50:25] Yin Fengwei: Sure. It's fine to me.\\n[09:50:31] Yin Fengwei: Let me summary it:\\n[09:50:34] danielthompson-rfn: Ok\\n[09:50:56] Yin Fengwei: For 1:1 meeting AND PS team meeting, they will be pushed to one hour later from next week.\\n[09:51:00] Yin Fengwei: Yes. I am OK with that.\\n[09:51:37] danielthompson-rfn: 1:1 meeting can probably stay where it is (you set it up so its in your TZ and is still OK for me).\\n[09:51:50] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[09:52:05] Yin Fengwei: 1:1 meeting will stay at current slot. PS team will be pushed one hour later.\\n[09:52:09] Yin Fengwei: Yes. That's fine to me.\\n[09:52:10] danielthompson-rfn: Yes.\\n[09:52:21] danielthompson-rfn: (unless its bad for someone else on the team)\\n[09:52:41] danielthompson-rfn: If that happens we'll follow up by mail.\\n[09:52:59] Yin Fengwei: OK. So will you send out the exact time slot for PS team meeting after sync with  whole team?\\n[09:53:04] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[09:53:07] Yin Fengwei: Get it.\\n[09:53:16] danielthompson-rfn: Great. That's all for me.\\n[09:53:32] Yin Fengwei: I suppose we are done today.\\n[09:53:38] danielthompson-rfn: Yes. Thanks for your time\\n[09:53:46] Yin Fengwei: Thank you.\\n[09:53:47] Yin Fengwei: And bye.\\n[09:53:50] danielthompson-rfn: Bye.\\n\\n # 1:1 @jasonL\\n\\nHow to improve the monthly report.\\n\\n * Do we need to keep the prepared summary information?\\n * It is a restatement of the weekly report\\n   + It is a significant effort to condense info from weekly reports\\n     into this format\\n * Need to gather Scott/Anmar/Joe's opinion\\n   + Neither @jasonL or @danielt are the audience for the report\\n   + No objections from my side\\n   + Do need to keep cards (with hyperlinks) to join graphs to units\\n     of work\\n\\nQuarterly report\\n\\n * Request from Joe to align extended reporting quarter boundaries\\n * Based Q3 report on the August six month report and \\\"reheat\\\" the\\n   metrics\\n * Graphs of interest\\n   - Quarter\\n   - Last twelve months\\n   - Year-to-date?\\n * Metrics will be a problem until next September\\n   - Seven months of cards without effort (spread across two databases)\\n   - Two months of effort information\\n * cards.linaro.org versus projects.linaro.org\\n   - Frustrates data collection\\n   - Suggestion (came from Scott/Joe) is to create spreadsheet from\\n     cards.linaro.org and use it to bridge the gap between the two\\n     data bases.\\n * Perhaps talk to Anmar?\\n\" }\n",

I think that's pretty much about it.\\ndanielt\\tGood work with the debrick tool.\\nSo its now in a position where you understand enough to load a u-boot payload and all the rest of the work is in fixing buts in the payload?\\npaulliu\\tyes. I'm loading a u-boot with gpt command and fastboot command.\\nAnd I can alter gpt tables, and fastboot linux onto it.\\nAnd also boot that linux.\\nAfter boot into that linux, I can flash the u-boot back to the hidden partition.\\ndanielt\\tWhat stops u-boot burning itself?\\npaulliu\\tI don't know fastboot very well. It seems to me that it doesn't like to write some raw images.\\ndanielt\\tThere are other ways for u-boot to write to flash...\\npaulliu\\tBut writing fat/ext4 fastboot does its job.\\nSo currently I'm going to linux, and then dd the u-boot back to the first partition.\\ndanielt\\tI see. I was only thinking that it would be good it we can remove a stage from the de-brick process.\\nPresumably we have to access u-boot console to configure gpt tables?\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\nSo we need to connect both console and usb port to de-brick\\ndanielt\\tIs it the *same* binary we put in flash that we put in RAM?\\n(for u-boot)\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\tIn that case it may be possible for u-boot to copy itself to flash (there may be some problems with the .bss section)\\n(but I expect u-boot self load will take care of that)\\npaulliu\\tok. any documentation?\\ndanielt\\tLots ;-) but I'll see if I can narrow it down.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tThe normal u-boot flow is to run network/uart-xfer tools to copy from communication link to RAM.... then copy from RAM to flash.\\npaulliu\\tAnd I'm now helping Actions kernel git tree.\\nDo you mean through ethernet port?\\ndanielt\\tLooks like the cp (memory copy) command in u-boot just \\\"knows\\\" about flash: http://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/UBootCmdGroupFlash\\nNot just ethernet port (you can use UART based file xfer as well)\\npaulliu\\tyou mean something like xmodem?\\ndanielt\\tYes.\\nHowever in our case u-boot is already in RAM.\\npaulliu\\tyeah.\\ndanielt\\tThat means we might be able to copy our own .text section and have it work.\\nReally depends on how variables are initialized by u-boot...\\nHowever I suspect there is code early in u-boot .text section to copy out what is need from .text to the variable sections.\\npaulliu\\tyeah.. I'll try that.. Seems ok.\\ndanielt\\tWorth a try... it might not work but it would be neat if it did.\\npaulliu\\tyeah..\\ndanielt\\tSo Actions git tree...\\nFirstly. Have actions agreed to adopt the git tree themselves?\\npaulliu\\tYes. They assign Dennis to do the job.\\ndanielt\\t... and they will use that git tree for their future releases?\\n(is Taiwan going to look after it or will HQ take it back?)\\npaulliu\\tThomas is currently pushing that back to HQ. We can find the answer next week I think.\\nI mean, when the git tree is done, the HQ have to be based on that tree.\\ndanielt\\tGreat. Thomas is right to push back... trying to be the bridge between .tar and git is not much fun.\\npaulliu\\tI'll need some information..\\ndanielt\\t???\\npaulliu\\tIs it ok to be based on 3.10?\\ndanielt\\tSort of.\\npaulliu\\tI mean, if the git tree is finished like we did on action5 branch. Is it ok to be put to linaro's git tree?\\ndanielt\\tNot entirely clear. Internal thinking is to develop and upstreaming plan and a strategy to get to 4.1 .\\npaulliu\\tThe question is : What is the quality level for the git tree to be put on Linaro's site?\\ndanielt\\tWe will accept (certify) a release based on 3.10 but I doubt we will accecpt ownership of such a tree.\\n(e.g. accept on Linaro site)\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\nSo that means they have to do a forward-porting to 4.1 to be put on Linaro's site, right?\\nSo, in a short term, I've read the mail about \\\"vendor build\\\". How to handle the vendor build?\\ndanielt\\tStepping back slightly...\\npaulliu\\tDo we put the binaries to our site? or we put a link to the site they established.\\ndanielt\\tI have been asked to put together a proposal, as much as possible based on the BSP analysis you and I did togheter, to produce an upstreaming plan and a 4.1 LTS kernel based on *backporting* the upstream patches.\\nWe hope to pitch this to Actions but there are ongoing discussion about how much help we can offer here.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tIn other words its a negotiated approach to the questions you raise... \\npaulliu\\tSeems there are still gaps.\\nThey want the board to be appeared on Linaro's site so they can have some promotions.\\ndanielt\\tIt we certify the board then it will appear on 96boards site.\\nLikewise I think we would also host the software downloads that meet our software requirements.\\nHowever for a 3.10 vendor build we have some requirements regarding vendor support for their kernel.\\n(i.e. that they will do so)\\npaulliu\\tok. So the software requirements is, we need to have an upstreaming plan and..  what do you mean 4.1 LTS kernel based on \\\"backporting\\\"?\\nbackport 4.1LTS kernel to Actions 3.10 branch?\\ndanielt\\tNo.\\nAdd upstream support (4.5 is earliest was could realistically target) and *backport* the upstreaming work.\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\nGot it.\\ndanielt\\t(4.1 LTS is a good basis for products, so it makes the upstreaming work pay off in the short term)\\npaulliu\\tSo they misunderstanding the backport. They told me backporting upstream (4.x) to 3.10 kernel. \\ndanielt\\tI saw that. We should do anything we can to disuade them from that.\\npaulliu\\tyeah.\\ndanielt\\tI guess they best way to think about it is Linaro will tolerate a 3.10 kernel but won't expend effort on improving it.\\nWe may expend effort helping Actions move forward since it benefits the 96Boards project (I say \\\"may\\\" because we haven't yet worked out where to go here).\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tPlease take care in that regard when talking to Actions!\\npaulliu\\tI know.\\ndanielt\\tIs it Tuesday you meet with Actions?\\npaulliu\\tMonday, because they are very worried now. So we do that earlier.\\ndanielt\\tI'd be supprised if we can get to an fully agreed intenal position by this Monday...\\npaulliu\\tI've just have some discussions with Dennis. Show him what we've done and he have to do it again..\\nBut that's all 3.10\\ndanielt\\tThe patch split out?\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\tHow big is the diff between the old SDK and the new SDK?\\npaulliu\\tVery big.\\nTheir current minSDK modified more stuff.\\nBut some problems are solved.\\ndanielt\\tI see. Does Dennis have access to internal git history?\\npaulliu\\tYes. He does.\\nSo I said he can re-use your patches/comments. And merge the further patches into those patches.\\ndanielt\\tGreat. You are ahead of me there. That's what I was going to say.\\n(although use cherry-pick not merge)\\npaulliu\\tI've send him the base checkout commit of actions5. Also Allen figures out the tarball's commit number. So he is able to know what are the new commits.\\ndanielt\\tThat means cherry-picking should work really well.\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\tWill actions want to \\\"censor\\\" the commit messages for the cherry picks?\\n(if they do... the can use \\\"rebase -i\\\" to fixup our original split out\\npaulliu\\tyeah. Dennis told me that the commits HQ made sometimes contains different subsystems in a single commit.\\nAlso some programmers are using Windows, so the CRLF makes the diff looks strange.\\ndanielt\\tdid you become familiar with \\\"rebase -i\\\" and the edit action?\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\t:-)\\nSo...\\nyou're nearly done on the debrick and are currently acting as a consultant for the Action devs.\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\tWhat do you hope/plan to work on next. \\n?\\npaulliu\\tI still have to work on D02 stuff right now.\\ndanielt\\tOk. That keeps you busy until next week?\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\tGreat.\\npaulliu\\tAnd for Actions, there are still regular meetings. But someone have to solve the political issuse.\\nI mean, they are seeking a way to put the board on webpage ASAP.\\nAnd I'm going to be chased by Thomas on the meeting.\\ndanielt\\tHmnnn....\\nWhy isn't that coming out in the e-mail threads with Scott?\\npaulliu\\tI don't know. Thomas wants me to say something good to Scott. So Scott can accept their boards.\\nSo that's why I'm asking what the quality they have to reach before that.\\nBut I can ask him to write mail directly to Scott\\ndanielt\\tI think that's the best advice you can offer him!\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nGot it. \\ndanielt\\tBy way of example, the hikey kernel has mostly been judged by testing rather than beautiful git structure.\\nHowever we need enough git structure to allow development to continue further.\\npaulliu\\tYeah. That's a must. CI, testing, are all based on that.\\ndanielt\\tRight.\\nOne thing you might want to do with Thomas is explore whether he agrees that 4.1 LTS is a good basis for Actions products (google just put a 4.1 kernel into AOSP).\\nI believe it is (and so do some of the other members I work with).\\nIf Thomas agrees its far more likely that working together on upstream/4.1LTS is an easy project to \\\"sell\\\" within actions.\\nMy own view is that they are building up problems basing new products on 3.10 and we are offering to help them out of that hole!\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nWhat I've heard is the HQ are rebasing things to 3.18.\\ndanielt\\tIs technical debt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) a term that makes sense for them?\\npaulliu\\tBut Thomas wants to stop it.\\ndanielt\\tbecause he wants to go further or because he thinks they should stay on 3.10?\\npaulliu\\tBecause if HQ are doing the rebasing, then Dennis' work will be a waste.\\nAnd that will postponed the bubblegum96.\\nto be appeared on the site.\\ndanielt is shocked\\ndanielt\\tThe value of community boards emerges because they help drive software progress closer to upstream.\\nThey should never be used as an argument to stay rooted in the past. That undermines their (business) reason to exist.\\npaulliu\\tYeah. But HQ won't release the git tree but a tarball.\\nSo if Dennis starts working on 3.10, Thomas wants HQ to be based on Dennis' tree.\\nAnd then go further.\\ndanielt\\tI see. I'l keep it in mind but I think that level of internal politics we have to stay out of.\\npaulliu\\tI'll see if I can push this to a correct direction.\\ndanielt\\tOk.\\nI'll do the same.\\nActions could really benefit from a level of membership (perhaps at LMG level) that allows their HQ team to come into the open a bit.\\nAnything else this week?\\npaulliu\\tNo.\\ndanielt\\tNor me...\\nAlthough there's one thing I'll finish with.\\n\\\"I look forward to reading your worklogs this week\\\" ;-)\\n(does this hint translate ok)\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tThanks.

It then uses this\\nfeature to allow the NMI backtrace code on arm to be implemented\\nusing FIQ.\\n\\nOther than the rebase the patchset is unchanged since previous posting.\\n\\nThe patches have been runtime tested on the following systems, covering\\nboth arm and arm64 systems and those with and without FIQ support:\\n\\n* Freescale i.MX6 (arm, gicv1, supports FIQ)\\n* qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -cpu cortex-a9 (arm, gicv1, does not\\n  support FIQ)\\n* qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -cpu cortex-a15 (arm, gicv2, supports \\n  FIQ)\\n* Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (arm, gicv2, does not support FIQ)\\n* Hisilicon 6220 (arm64, gicv2, does not support FIQ)\\n  \\nv23:\\n\\n* Fixed build on systems without CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER (0-day test\\n  robot)\\n* Rebased on v4.7-rc3 and added the Acked-by:s from v22 and v23.\\n* Remove the double register write when raising an SGI by created local \\n  shadow of the SGI group bits (Marc Zyngier)\\n* Fixed an out-by-one error in one of the WARNings (Marc Zygnier)\\n* Added logic to cache whether or not the GIC support interrupt grouping\\n  (Marc Zygnier)\\n* Added a comment to explain an unexpected #ifdef CONFIG_ARM and applied\\n  the magic nit comb (Marc Zygnier)\\n\\nv22:\\n\\n* Rebase on v4.4-rc5 to adopt the new NMI backtrace code from Russell\\n  King.\\n\\n* Polished a few comments and reorganised the patches very slightly\\n  (shifted a couple of arm changes to patch 4).\\n\\n* Fixed bug in the way gic_handle_fiq() checks whether it is safe for\\n  it to read IAR.\\n\\nv21:\\n\\n* Change the way SGIs are raised to try to increase robustness starting\\n  secondary cores. This is a theoretic fix for a regression reported\\n  by Mark Rutland on vexpress-tc2 but it also allows us to remove\\n  igroup0_shadow entirely since it is no longer needed.\\n\\n* Fix a couple of variable names and add comments to describe the\\n  hardware behavior better (Mark Rutland).\\n\\n* Improved MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER support by clearing FIQs using\\n  handle_arch_irq (Marc Zygnier).\\n\\n* Fix gic_cpu_if_down() to ensure group 1 interrupts are disabled\\n  when the interface is brought down.\\n\\nFor changes in v20 and earlier see:\\n  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1928465\\n\\n#v20:\\n#\\n#* Fixed bad coding style (removed \\\"if (0 != func())\\\") (Steven Rostedt\\n#  and Borislav Petkov).\\n#* Rebased on v4.0-rc7.\\n#\\n#v19:\\n#\\n#* Remove redundant memory barrier inherited from the x86 code (Steven\\n#  Rostedt).\\n#\\n#v18:\\n#\\n#* Move printk_nmi_ functions out of printk.c and into their own\\n#  file, nmi_callback.c (Joe Perches/Steven Rostedt).\\n#\\n#* Rename printk_nmi_ functions so their name matches their new home\\n#  (Joe Perches)\\n#\\n#v17:\\n#\\n#* Rename bl_migration_lock/unlock to gic_migration_lock/unlock\\n#  (Nicolas Pitre).\\n#\\n#v16:\\n#\\n#* Significant clean up of the printk patches (Thomas Gleixner).\\n#  Replacing macros with real functions, CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_NMI_PRINTK\\n#  -> CONFIG_PRINTK_NMI, prefixing global functions with printk_nmi,\\n#  removing pointless exports, removing cpu_mask from the interfaces,\\n#  removal of just-in-time initialization of trace buffers, prevented\\n#  call sites having to save state, rolled up variable declarations\\n#  into single lines.\\n#\\n#* Dropped the sched_clock() patches from *this* patchset and managed\\n#  them separately (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1879261 ).\\n#  The cross-dependancies between the patches are minimal; the backtrace\\n#  code only calls sched_clock() if we are ftracing and backtracing is\\n#  normally only triggered to report information about about a broken\\n#  system (although users can type SysRq-l for amusement, most use it\\n#  to find out why the system it dead).\\n#\\n#* Squashed together the final two patches. Essentially these duplicated\\n#  the x86 code and slavishly avoided changing it before, in the next\\n#  patch, fixing it to work better on ARM. It seems better that the code\\n#  just works first time!\\n#\\n#v15:\\n#\\n#* Added a patch to make sched_clock safe to call from NMI (Stephen\\n#  Boyd). Note that sched_clock() is not called by the NMI handlers that\\n#  have been added for the arm but it could be called if tools such as\\n#  ftrace are deployed.\\n#\\n#* Fixed some warnings picked up during bisectability testing.\\n#\\n#v14:\\n#\\n#* Moved a nmi_vprintk() and friends from arch/x86/kernel/apic/hw_nmi.c\\n#  to printk.c (Steven Rostedt)\\n#\\n#v13:\\n#\\n#* Updated the code to print the backtrace to replicate Steven Rostedt's\\n#  x86 work to make SysRq-l safe. This is pretty much a total rewrite of\\n#  patches 4 and 5.\\n#\\n#v12:\\n#\\n#* Squash first two patches into a single one and re-describe\\n#  (Thomas Gleixner).\\n# \\n#* Improve description of \\\"irqchip: gic: Make gic_raise_softirq FIQ-safe\\\"\\n#  (Thomas Gleixner).\\n#\\n#v11:\\n#\\n#* Optimized gic_raise_softirq() by replacing a register read with\\n#  a memory read (Jason Cooper).\\n#  \\n#v10:\\n#\\n#* Add a further patch to optimize away some of the locking on systems\\n#  where CONFIG_BL_SWITCHER is not set (Marc Zyngier). Compiles OK with\\n#  exynos_defconfig (which is the only defconfig to set this option).\\n#\\n#* Whitespace fixes in patch 4. That patch previously used spaces for\\n#  alignment of new constants but the rest of the file used tabs.\\n#\\n#v9:\\n#\\n#* Improved documentation and structure of initial patch (now initial\\n#  two patches) to make gic_raise_softirq() safe to call from FIQ\\n#  (Thomas Gleixner).\\n#\\n#* Avoid masking interrupts during gic_raise_softirq(). The use of the\\n#  read lock makes this redundant (because we can safely re-enter the\\n#  function).\\n#\\n#v8:\\n#\\n#* Fixed build on arm64 causes by a spurious include file in irq-gic.c.\\n#\\n#v7-2 (accidentally released twice with same number):\\n#\\n#* Fixed boot regression on vexpress-a9 (reported by Russell King).\\n#\\n#* Rebased on v3.18-rc3; removed one patch from set that is already\\n#  included in mainline.\\n#\\n#* Dropped arm64/fiq.h patch from the set (still useful but not related\\n#  to issuing backtraces).\\n#\\n#v7:\\n#\\n#* Re-arranged code within the patch series to fix a regression\\n#  introduced midway through the series and corrected by a later patch\\n#  (testing by Olof's autobuilder). Tested offending patch in isolation\\n#  using defconfig identified by the autobuilder.\\n#\\n#v6:\\n#\\n#* Renamed svc_entry's call_trace argument to just trace (example code\\n#  from Russell King).\\n#\\n#* Fixed mismatched ENDPROC() in __fiq_abt (example code from Russell\\n#  King).\\n#\\n#* Modified usr_entry to optional avoid calling into the trace code and\\n#  used this in FIQ entry from usr path. Modified corresponding exit code\\n#  to avoid calling into trace code and the scheduler (example code from\\n#  Russell King).\\n#\\n#* Ensured the default FIQ register state is restored when the default\\n#  FIQ handler is reinstalled (example code from Russell King).\\n#\\n#* Renamed no_fiq_insn to dfl_fiq_insn to reflect the effect of adopting\\n#  a default FIQ handler.\\n#\\n#* Re-instated fiq_safe_migration_lock and associated logic in\\n#  gic_raise_softirq(). gic_raise_softirq() is called by wake_up_klogd()\\n#  in the console unlock logic.\\n#\\n#v5:\\n#\\n#* Rebased on 3.17-rc4.\\n#\\n#* Removed a spurious line from the final \\\"glue it together\\\" patch\\n#  that broke the build.\\n#\\n#v4:\\n#\\n#* Replaced push/pop with stmfd/ldmfd respectively (review of Nicolas\\n#  Pitre).\\n#\\n#* Really fix bad pt_regs pointer generation in __fiq_abt.\\n#\\n#* Remove fiq_safe_migration_lock and associated logic in\\n#  gic_raise_softirq() (review of Russell King)\\n#\\n#* Restructured to introduce the default FIQ handler first, before the\\n#  new features (review of Russell King).\\n#\\n#v3:\\n#\\n#* Removed redundant header guards from arch/arm64/include/asm/fiq.h\\n#  (review of Catalin Marinas).\\n#\\n#* Moved svc_exit_via_fiq macro to entry-header.S (review of Nicolas\\n#  Pitre).\\n#\\n#v2:\\n#\\n#* Restructured to sit nicely on a similar FYI patchset from Russell\\n#  King. It now effectively replaces the work in progress final patch\\n#  with something much more complete.\\n#\\n#* Implemented (and tested) a Thumb-2 implementation of svc_exit_via_fiq\\n#  (review of Nicolas Pitre)\\n# \\n#* Dropped the GIC group 0 workaround patch. The issue of FIQ interrupts\\n#  being acknowledged by the IRQ handler does still exist but should be\\n#  harmless because the IRQ handler will still wind up calling\\n#  ipi_cpu_backtrace().\\n#  \\n#* Removed any dependency on CONFIG_FIQ; all cpu backtrace effectively\\n#  becomes a platform feature (although the use of non-maskable\\n#  interrupts to implement it is best effort rather than guaranteed).\\n#  \\n#* Better comments highlighting usage of RAZ/WI registers (and parts of\\n#  registers) in the GIC code.\\n#\\n#Changes *before* v1:\\n#\\n#* This patchset is a hugely cut-down successor to \\\"[PATCH v11 00/19]\\n#  arm: KGDB NMI/FIQ support\\\".

For historic details see:\\n#        https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/2/227\\n# \\n#* Fix bug in __fiq_abt (no longer passes a bad struct pt_regs value).\\n#  In fixing this we also remove the useless indirection previously\\n#  found in the fiq_handler macro.\\n# \\n#* Make default fiq handler \\\"always on\\\" by migrating from fiq.c to\\n#  traps.c and replace do_unexp_fiq with the new handler (review\\n#  of Russell King).\\n#\\n#* Add arm64 version of fiq.h (review of Russell King)\\n#\\n#* Removed conditional branching and code from irq-gic.c, this is\\n#  replaced by much simpler code that relies on the GIC specification's\\n#  heavy use of read-as-zero/write-ignored (review of Russell King)\\n#\\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Jason Cooper <jason@lakedaemon.net>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Russell King <linux@arm.linux.org.uk>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc patches@linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linaro-kernel@lists.linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Sumit Semwal <sumit.semwal@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Dirk Behme <dirk.behme@de.bosch.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Daniel Drake <drake@endlessm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Dmitry Pervushin <dpervushin@gmail.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Tim Sander <tim@krieglstein.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Petr Mladek <pmladek@suse.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Lucas Stach <l.stach@pengutronix.de>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix \\\"PATCH 4.8-rc1 v23\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cover-letter --signoff \\\\\\n\\t-4\\n\\nv23: <1467298664-24039-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv22: <1450644757-18734-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv21: <1436188438-9478-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\ntryagain: <reset the threading here>\\nv20: <1428659511-9590-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nresend: <1427216014-5324-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv19: <1427216014-5324-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\ntryagain: <reset the threading here>\\nv18: <1426167561-25963-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv17: <1425463974-23568-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv16: <1422990417-1783-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv15: <1422022952-31552-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\ntryagain: <reset the threading here>\\nv14: <1421144818-14036-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv13: <1420469699-25350-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv12: <1417191374-26719-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv11: <1417119024-22844-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv10: <1417019010-9220-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv9: <1415968543-29469-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv8: <1415968543-29469-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nrmk: <doesnt-like-threading-to-previous-versions-so-thread-all-from-v8>\\nv7-2: <1415183260-6389-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv7: <1415183260-6389-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv6: <1410695835-10496-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv5: <1410435078-28462-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv4: <1410272111-30516-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv3: <1410190115-32604-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv2: <1409931198-22600-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv1: <1409846620-14542-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\n\\n #

Select suitable development platform\\n\\n2. Bring up an Android system using Linaro's DRM based hwcomposer\\n\\n3a. Back port Rob Clark's patches (and any required DRM infra changes)\\n    to the platform\\n\\n3b. Forward port the development platforms kernel to make is easy to\\n    merge in Rob's patches \\n\\n3c. Some optimal conbination of the above\\n\\n4. Modify the DRM based hwcomposer to use the new properties\\n   interface.  \\n\\n5. Make the setting of the properties use a single ioctl (go\\n   atomic).  \\n\\n6. Verify hwcomposer still functions with atomic pageflip patches\\n   removed (to avoid user/kernel version skew problems on different\\n   platforms).  \\n\\nProvide results back to either the Linaro owner or AOSP.\\n\\n== DRM/KMS dma-buf atomic fence support ==\\n\\nRequires: KWG-529: Extend DRM hwcomposer to support properties\\n\\nCheck for and, if needed, provide a means for a driver, with\\nfew lines-of-code, to wait for all fences (if any) attached\\nto a dma-buf's to fire.\\n\\nWithin ADF all fences that are passed within an atomic scene\\nupdate must fire before the screen gets updated.\\n\\nWe need to figure out if this is a useful feature or comes as part of\\nADF's philosophy of simplification. \\n\\n  Relavent questions: Does this approach work for Android TV?  What\\n  happens when one of the overlays is updating a 15 or 25fps and the\\n  frame decode is very expensive (say, takes ~16.7ms per decode)?\\n\\nIf this *is* a useful feature we may need to collect all the fences\\nfrom a single property list and wait for them all to fire.\\n\\n== Custom pixel formats ==\\n\\nRequires: Identification of motivating hardware\\n\\nCustom pixel formats often emerge as part of a strategy to\\nreduce memory bandwidth.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n1. Video decoders sometimes use custom formats to boost\\n   locality of reference when handling reference\\n   frames. \\n   \\n2. GPUs often seek to losslessly compress RGB buffers to\\n   make manipulating data faster.\\n\\nWhenever buffers of these formats are exposed to userspace (even\\nif it is only userspace plumbing rather than data processing)\\nthen we need to be able to descibe the pixel format of such\\nbuffers as they are passed on DRM/KMS.\\n\\nIdentify motivational hardware and add support for non-standard pixel\\nformats to upstream DRM/KMS drivers. Ideally any concepts introduced\\nshould be reusable by other drivers based on differently non-standard\\npixel formats.\\n\\nPossibly this could be as simple as allowing drivers to provide a\\nlist of custom FOURCC formats they support. Whenever the driver\\nverifies buffers (e.g. actual size versus meta-data) it can pick\\noff these values before calling helpers to handle the standardized\\nformats.\\n\\n== Provide DRM with iommu helper functions ==\\n\\nRequires: Identification of IOMMU based hardware\\n\\nDRM/KMS drivers that use CMA to allocate \\\"dumb buffers\\\" and which\\nmandate physically contigious buffers for display have nearly no\\nGEM boilerplate. Indead they use the helper functions from\\ndrm/drm_gem_cma_helper.h requiring only two function calls and\\nsome ops able population.\\n\\nSimilar helper functions should be feasible to simplify drivers\\nwhose compositor hardware has an iommu. Implement this.\\n\\n== Helpers for property setting ==\\n\\nOne of ADF's motivations is to reduce the LOC count need to implement a\\ndriver. ADFs use of binary blobs to pass meta-data between a hardware\\nspecific hwcomposer and a ADF driver is largely motivated by a desire to\\nnot place an serialization/deserialization between hwcomposer and\\ndriver.\\n\\nThis is viewed as infeasible in the context of DRM/KMS due to the desire\\nto make it possible for the userspace to get images onto the screen\\nwithout requiring the userspace to have deep knowledge of the hardware.\\n\\nNevertheless it would be useful for drivers to utilize helpers to\\nmaintain the drivers current property state (and to help rollback the\\nstate when atomicity is impossible)).\\n\\nInvestigate opportunities to reduce driver LOC count and implement\\nany recommendations.\\n\\n== Optimized hwcomposer ==\\n\\nRequires: DRM/KMS at or very near feature parity with ADF.\\n\\nDRM/KMS makes it posssible for the userspace to get images onto the\\nscreen without requiring the userspace to have deep knowledge of the\\nhardware. Nevertheless it is believed that an optimized composition\\nsystem must rely on specific hardware knowledge.\\n\\nAs a simply example, the hwcomposer, when presented with a list of\\nlayers, must mark each on as overlay or GLES composition. The power\\ntrade off[1] implicit in this decision requires a significant level of\\nhardware knowledge.\\n\\nIdentify an optimized hwcomposer based on ADF and verify (by\\ndemonstration) that is possible to achieve similar optimizations\\nby customizing the DRM hwcomposer.\\n\\n[1]\\nFor animation at 60fps them hardware composition is likely to requires\\nless power than GPU composition. However as the refresh rate drops\\nso does the benefit of hardware composition drops. For static images\\nGPU composition is typically more power efficient.\\n\\n== Modelling complex display topologies ==\\n\\nRequires: Identification of motivating hardware\\n\\nSome hardware is difficult to map to the KMS object model. One example\\nis, as display sizes increase, some hardware designs propose that mixers\\nbe \\\"ganged up\\\" to produce an image from underspecified hardware within\\nthe real time contraints.\\n\\nCheck whether such hardware fits into the KMS object model and propose\\nextensions to permit this.\\n\\n  TODO: Detailed task breakdown is of limited value. Not only is the\\n  hardware not yet identified by activity in the PC space, such as the\\n  effort to support very high resolution monitors using two PHYs, may\\n  render it moot.\\n\\n== Modelling non-memory backed pixel sources ==\\n\\nHardware that presents images from somewhere other than memory\\n(single colour scan out, hardware overlays from HMDI input) is\\nnot currently modelled by KMS.\\n\\n  TODO: Detailed task breakdown is of limited value. The role within\\n  Android of non-memory backed pixel sources is unclear, as is the\\n  likely overlap with media controller/V4L2 w.r.t. video signals.\\n\\n\" }\n",

Fathi agreed to generate Debian GNOME image if we make\\n     an official request.\\n\\n * Qualcomm: WiFi and BT for DragonBoard 410c [Fengwei] (PS-12)\\n   - The bluescreen issue was workaround by raising bus bandwidth\\n     and the driver was merged to 4.0-integeration branch\\n     for demo.\\n   - One timing issue was exposed after the driver merging. A patch\\n     to fix this was created and merged.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: backport \\\"arm64: Add audit support\\\" to 3.10 LSK\\n   [Fengwei] (PS-47)\\n   - This work is completed.\\n   - Highlights:\\n      + After studying LSK for Android we determined that the backport\\n        had already been partially undertaken for AOSP.\\n      + Completed by backporting two further patches (from AKASHI\\n        Takahiro) and an additional patch to fix a KConfig issue.\\n      + Member confirmed that smoke tests pass and that CTS did not \\n        raise any issues related to the backport.\\n   - Lowlights:\\n      + There was some initial confusion about whether or not this\\n        work should be within scope of premium services. Guide for\\n        field engineers has been updated.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Spreadtrum member build for TSharkT ARM64 board\\n   [Fengwei, Jam] (PS-63)\\n   - Got the TSharkT ARM64 board from Jam.\\n   - Code delivery from member cannot be built, trying to contact\\n     Spreadtrum interface about this.\\n   - Determining logistics for shipping board, which includes a\\n     battery, to developers. The board is a cell phone but can\\n     run on AC power with the battery removed. We will mail boards\\n     without batteries and hand carry batteries at SFO15.\\n\\n * TI: Presentation on Android GFX and DRM/KMS [Daniel] (PS-23)\\n   - This work is completed.\\n   - Highlights:\\n      + Provided member a useful primer to a technical subject that\\n        typically crosses competence boundaries between kernel and\\n        android teams.\\n      + Quality of questions asked during presentation strongly\\n        suggests presentation was pitched at the right technical level.\\n   - Lowlights:\\n      + Almost two months elapsed between completing the presentation\\n        material and presenting it to member. This was primarily due to\\n        delays in getting the calendars of member engineers to align,\\n        although we (LPS) will also seek to communicate status more\\n        explicitly in future.\\n\\n * ZTE: Power management training/consultancy [Leo, Daniel] (PS-62)\\n   - Front-to-back review of all slides resulting in a mixture of\\n     rewording and raising questions.

To be\\nclear ftrace is *seriously* awesome and I could easily fill the entire\\nof today's session talking about filtering, triggers and advanced\\ntracers. That would also be a great talk but I sent in an Abstract that\\npromised to talk about tracepoints so that is where we are going to go\\nfrom here.\\n\\n``` sh\\nless README\\nfind events -type d\\n```\\n\\nThat's it... we can all go home!\\n\\n# regmap\\n\\nDemonstrates: *tracepoints, test glob filtering*, *numeric filtering*\\n\\nRegmap is an interested sub-system. It's genesis was as a means to\\nabstract the bus used to access registers for devices that support\\nmultiple register access protocols. For example a temperature sensor\\nthat can be interfaced with either I2C or SPI. Using regmap to abstract\\nthe accessors allows the same driver to support both modes with\\nminimal effort.\\n\\nHowever regmap has been extended with multiple protocols, including\\nmemory mapped I/O, where it is great for coping with peripherals who\\nreorganised the register layout in version 2 but without changing the\\nfeature set much.\\n\\nAnyhow, regmap gives the driver a lot of things for free. For example\\nit reveals the register state via debugfs... and each accessor contains\\na tracepoint.\\n\\n``` sh\\nls /sys/kernel/debug/regmap\\n```\\n\\n# regmap - Lenovo Yoga C630 (arm64)\\n\\n``` sh\\n# Uses regmap to access PMIC registers\\necho 1 > events/regmap/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\ncat events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/format\\necho 'name ~ \\\"*thermal*\\\"' > events/regmap/filter\\ncat trace_pipe\\ncat events/regmap/filter\\ncat events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/filter\\n\\ncat events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/format\\necho 'name ~ \\\"*thermal*\\\" && reg == 0xc0' > events/regmap/filter\\ncat trace_pipe\\n```\\n\\n# regmap - Lenovo Yoga 910 (x86_64)\\n\\nNote: *This will not be presented... unless there is trouble with the WiFi...*\\n\\n``` sh\\n# Uses regmap to abstract codec registers\\necho 1 > events/regmap/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\ncat events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/format\\necho 'name ~ \\\"hdaudio*\\\"' > events/regmap/filter\\necho > trace\\ncat trace_pipe\\ncat events/regmap/filter\\ncat events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/filter\\n\\necho 'name ~ \\\"notaudio*\\\"' > events/regmap/filter\\necho > trace\\ncat trace-pipe\\n```\\n\\n# i2c\\n===\\n\\nDemonstrates: *tracepoints*, *numeric filtering*, *triggers*, *histograms*\\n\\nMoving on from regmap I thought we'd spend a moment looking at\\nthe i2c tracepoints. I picked these because I hope you will all\\nfind it fairly easy to understand how the i2c bus works. I can also\\nmention that on the (64-bit Arm) laptop running this demo then the\\nkeyboard, trackpad and touchscreen are all connecting using the\\nhid-over-i2c protocol which makes it easy for me to provoke\\ni2c activity on this system.\\n\\n``` sh\\necho 1 > events/i2c/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\n# Examine output and remember which adapter is keyboard, trackpad, etc\\nkb=11\\ntp=3\\n```\\n\\n# i2c - Continued\\n\\n``` sh\\ncat events/i2c/i2c_reply/format\\necho 'adapter_nr == $tp' > events/i2c/filter\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\necho 'adapter_nr == $kb' > events/i2c/filter\\necho 'stacktrace' > events/i2c/i2c_read/trigger\\ncat trace_pipe \\necho '!stacktrace' > events/i2c/i2c_read/trigger\\n\\ncat events/i2c/i2c_read/format\\necho 'hist:keys=stacktace,adapter_nr'\\nwatch cat events/i2c/i2c_read/hist\\necho '!hist'\\n```\\n\\n# Dynamic probes\\n\\nDemonstrates: *dynamic tracepoints*, *numeric filtering*, *errors in filtering*\\n\\nSo far we have relied entirely upon static tracepoints built into the\\nkernel. There are lots of them and I encourage you to look though the\\n`events` directory on your laptop or target devices and look and see\\nwhat interests you.\\n\\nHowever the real secret of where to find Fantastic Tracepoints is that\\nyou can dynamically add tracepoints almost anywhere in the kernel\\nmeaning the ultimate tool for findinng tracepoints is the source code.\\n\\nIn this example we're going to trace VFS functions. Again this is\\nbecause the relationship between what I type at the keyboard and which\\nVFS functions will be used should be fairly clear to you.\\n\\n# Dynamic probes - Continued\\n\\n``` sh\\necho 'p:vfs_read __vfs_read' > kprobe_events\\necho 1 > events/kprobes/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\necho 'r:vfs_read_retval __vfs_read $retval' >> kprobe_events\\necho 1 > events/kprobes/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\n\\necho 0 > events/kprobes/enable\\necho 'p:vfs_read __vfs_read iname=+56(+24(%x0)):string count=%x2:x64' \\\\\\n\\t\\t> kprobe_events\\ncat events/kprobes/vfs_read/format\\ncat trace_pipe\\n```\\n\\n# Bonus Puzzle\\n \\nThis will not be presented...\\n \\n*Steven Rostedt shared this at ELCE18... what does it do?*\\n\\n*[requires a \\\"sane\\\" 64-bit kernel without structure randomization for the\\noffsets to work... the offsets will eventually drift; I last tested it\\non v4.20)]*\\n\\n```\\necho 'p:crazy __vfs_read name=+0(+0(+40(+40(+32($arg1))))):string' \\\\\\n\\t\\t> kprobe_events\\n\\n# If you don't have argX support in your kernel but you *do* have an\\n# arm64 kernel then try this instead\\necho 'p:crazy __vfs_read name=+0(+0(+40(+40(+32(%x0))))):string' \\\\\\n\\t\\t> kprobe_events\\n```\\n\\n# Dynamic probes with perf probe\\n\\nJust stop and reflect for a second that everything I have shown you so\\nfar has been based on basic tools that can be found in almost all\\nLinux based systems, from fully fledged GNU/Linux distros through to\\nembedded systems based on busybox/musl or Android. Not only that but\\nif you need a memory jogger to remind you how the trace system works\\nthe mini-HOWTO is built into the kernel:\\n`/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/README` .\\n\\nAnyhow... we've finished doing it by hand. Let's see what happens if\\nwe bring in a few tools to help us.\\n\\nIn this case we're going to use perf's symbolic debug facilities to\\ncreate tracepoints without having to resort to machine level debug\\ntechniques.\\n\\n# Dynamic probes with perf probe - Continued\\n\\n``` sh\\nperf probe \\\\\\n    '__vfs_read iname=file->f_path.dentry->d_iname:string count=count'\\necho 1 > events/probe/__vfs_read/enable\\ncat trace_pipe\\necho 0 > events/enable\\nperf probe -d __vfs_read\\n```\\n\\nThere is even cross-tooling support that allows `perf probe` to do the\\nsymbolic work on a development workstation and generate probe strings\\nready to copy to an under resourced target machine.\\n\\n```\\nperf probe -D \\\\\\n    '__vfs_read iname=file->f_path.dentry->d_iname:string count=count'\\nperf probe --vmlinux ~drt/Development/Kernel/linux/vmlinux -D \\\\\\n    '__vfs_read iname=file->f_path.dentry->d_iname:string count=count'\\n```\\n\\n# Tracepoints and ply\\n\\nTo close out the session I'd like to when two powerful kernel tools meet\\neach other: in this example let's see what happens when dynamic\\ntracepoints and eBPF, the kernel's built-in virtual machine are\\nintroduced to each other.\\n\\nWe'll be using the lightweight `ply` tool for this. There are larger and\\nmore powerful eBPF toolchains out there... but `ply` has no dependancies\\nand should be easy to get working on whatever distribution you find\\nyourself. `ply` is an `awk`-like mini-language that allows us to\\nattach code to one or more tracepoints.\\n\\n# Tracepoints and ply - part 1\\n\\nFirstly lets try a simple one-liner\\n\\n``` sh\\nply -t 5 -c 'kprobe:kmem_cache_alloc_node { @[stack()].count() }'\\n```\\n\\nIf you are paying attention you'll be getting a sense of deja-vu here...\\nthis is very similar to the histogram triggers we attached to the\\ni2c_read tracepoint.\\n\\n# Tracepoints and ply - part 2\\n\\nSo... let's look at something we can't do with tracepoints alone.\\n\\n``` sh\\ncd $HOME\\ncat > track.ply <<EOF\\nkprobe:kmem_cache_alloc_node {\\n# Can’t read stack from a retprobe :-(\\n\\t@[0] = stack();\\n}\\nkretprobe:kmem_cache_alloc_node {\\n\\t@[retval()] = @[0];\\n\\t@[0] = nil;\\n}\\nkprobe:kmem_cache_free {\\n\\t@[arg(1)] = nil;\\n}\\nEOF\\nply track.ply\\n```\\n\\nNote: *Get ply from https://github.com/iovisor/ply*\\n\\n# Thanks\\n\\nTHANK YOU!\\n\\nAny questions about this presentation?\\nsupport@linaro.org\\n\\n\\nAny questions about any other Linaro activity?\\n(if you work for a member company)\\nsupport@linaro.org\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\nWith special thanks to: Steven Rostedt, Masami Hiramatsu and Leo Yan\\n\" }\n",

      "NoteBody { id: \"2f696f5b1c684326b86b3654e735c9ed\", body: \"# Joplin Data API\\n\\nThis API is available when the clipper server is running. It provides access to the notes, notebooks, tags and other Joplin object via a REST API. Plugins can also access this API even when the clipper server is not running.\\n\\nIn order to use it, you'll first need to find on which port the service is running. To do so, open the Web Clipper Options in Joplin and if the service is running it should tell you on which port. Normally it runs on port **41184**. If you want to find it programmatically, you may follow this kind of algorithm:\\n\\n```\\nlet port = \\n\\nnull;\\n\\nfor \\n\\n(let portToTest = \\n\\n41184; portToTest <= \\n\\n41194; portToTest++) \\n\\n{\\n\\n    const result = \\n\\npingPort(portToTest); \\n\\n// Call GET /ping    if \\n\\n(result == \\n\\n'JoplinClipperServer') \\n\\n{        port = portToTest; \\n\\n// Found the port        break;    }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo prevent unauthorised applications from accessing the API, the calls must be authentified. To do so, you must provide a token as a query parameter for each API call. You can get this token from the Joplin desktop application, on the Web Clipper Options screen.\\n\\nThis would be an example of valid cURL call using a token:\\n\\n```\\ncurl http://localhost:41184/notes?token=ABCD123ABCD123ABCD123ABCD123ABCD123\\n```\\n\\nIn the documentation below, the token will not be specified every time however you will need to include it.\\n\\nIf needed you may also [request the token programmatically](https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/spec/clipper_auth)\\n\\n## Using the API[\\u{200b}](#using-the-api \\\"Direct link to Using the API\\\")\\n\\nAll the calls, unless noted otherwise, receives and send **JSON data**. For example to create a new note:\\n\\n```\\ncurl --data '{ \\\"title\\\": \\\"My note\\\", \\\"body\\\": \\\"Some note in **Markdown**\\\"}' http://localhost:41184/notes\\n```\\n\\nIn the documentation below, the calls may include special parameters such as :id or :note\\\\_id. You would replace this with the item ID or note ID.\\n\\nFor example, for the endpoint `DELETE /tags/:id/notes/:note_id`, to remove the tag with ID \\\"ABCD1234\\\" from the note with ID \\\"EFGH789\\\", you would run for example:\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:41184/tags/ABCD1234/notes/EFGH789\\n```\\n\\nThe four verbs supported by the API are the following ones:\\n\\n- **GET**: To retrieve items (notes, notebooks, etc.).\\n- **POST**: To create new items. In general most item properties are optional. If you omit any, a default value will be used.\\n- **PUT**: To update an item. Note in a REST API, traditionally PUT is used to completely replace an item, however in this API it will only replace the properties that are provided. For example if you PUT {\\\"title\\\": \\\"my new title\\\"}, only the \\\"title\\\" property will be changed. The other properties will be left untouched (they won't be cleared nor changed).\\n- **DELETE**: To delete items.\\n\\n## Filtering data[\\u{200b}](#filtering-data \\\"Direct link to Filtering data\\\")\\n\\nYou can change the fields that will be returned by the API using the `fields=` query parameter, which takes a list of comma separated fields. For example, to get the longitude and latitude of a note, use this:\\n\\n```\\ncurl http://localhost:41184/notes/ABCD123?fields=longitude,latitude\\n```\\n\\nTo get the IDs only of all the tags:\\n\\n```\\ncurl http://localhost:41184/tags?fields=id\\n```\\n\\nBy default API results will contain the following fields: **id**, **parent\\\\_id**, **title**\\n\\nAll API calls that return multiple results will be paginated and will return the following structure:\\n\\n| Key | Always present? | Description |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| `items` | Yes | The array of items you have requested. |\\n| `has_more` | Yes | If `true`, there are more items after this page. If `false`, it means you have reached the end of the data set. |\\n\\nYou can specify how the results should be sorted using the `order_by` and `order_dir` query parameters, and which page to retrieve using the `page` parameter (starts at and defaults to 1). You can specify the number of items to be returned using the `limit` parameter (the maximum being 100 items).\\n\\nThe following call for example will initiate a request to fetch all the notes, 10 at a time, and sorted by \\\"updated\\\\_time\\\" ascending:\\n\\n```\\ncurl http://localhost:41184/notes?order_by=updated_time&order_dir=ASC&limit=10\\n```\\n\\nThis will return a result like this\\n\\n```\\n{ \\n\\n\\\"items\\\": \\n\\n[ \\n\\n/* 10 notes */ \\n\\n], \\n\\n\\\"has_more\\\": \\n\\ntrue \\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen you will resume fetching the results using this query:\\n\\n```\\ncurl http://localhost:41184/notes?order_by=updated_time&order_dir=ASC&limit=10&page=2\\n```\\n\\nEventually you will get some results that do not contain an \\\"has\\\\_more\\\" paramater, at which point you will have retrieved all the results\\n\\nAs an example the pseudo-code below could be used to fetch all the notes:\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\nasync \\n\\nfunction \\n\\nfetchJson(url) \\n\\n{\\n\\n    return \\n\\n(await \\n\\nfetch(url)).json();\\n\\n}\\n\\nasync \\n\\nfunction \\n\\nfetchAllNotes() \\n\\n{\\n\\n    let pageNum = \\n\\n1;    do \\n\\n{        const response = \\n\\nawait \\n\\nfetchJson((http://localhost:41184/notes?page=' + pageNum++);        console.info('Printing notes:', response.items);    } \\n\\nwhile \\n\\n(response.has_more)\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Error handling[\\u{200b}](#error-handling \\\"Direct link to Error handling\\\")\\n\\nIn case of an error, an HTTP status code >= 400 will be returned along with a JSON object that provides more info about the error. The JSON object is in the format `{ \\\"error\\\": \\\"description of error\\\" }`.\\n\\n## About the property types[\\u{200b}](#about-the-property-types \\\"Direct link to About the property types\\\")\\n\\n- Text is UTF-8.\\n- All date/time are Unix timestamps in milliseconds.\\n- Booleans are integer values 0 or 1.\\n\\n## Testing if the service is available[\\u{200b}](#testing-if-the-service-is-available \\\"Direct link to Testing if the service is available\\\")\\n\\nCall **GET /ping** to check if the service is available. It should return \\\"JoplinClipperServer\\\" if it works.\\n\\n## Searching[\\u{200b}](#searching \\\"Direct link to Searching\\\")\\n\\nCall **GET /search?query=YOUR\\\\_QUERY** to search for notes. This end-point supports the `field` parameter which is recommended to use so that you only get the data that you need. The query syntax is as described in the main documentation: https://joplinapp.org/help/#searching\\n\\nTo retrieve non-notes items, such as notebooks or tags, add a `type` parameter and set it to the required [item type name](#item-type-id). In that case, full text search will not be used - instead it will be a simple case-insensitive search. You can also use `*` as a wildcard. This is convenient for example to retrieve notebooks or tags by title.\\n\\nFor example, to retrieve the notebook named `recipes`: **GET /search?query=recipes&type=folder**\\n\\nTo retrieve all the tags that start with `project-`: **GET /search?query=project-\\\\*&type=tag**\\n\\n## Item type IDs[\\u{200b}](#item-type-ids \\\"Direct link to Item type IDs\\\")\\n\\nItem type IDs might be refered to in certain object you will retrieve from the API. This is the correspondance between name and ID:\\n\\n| Name | Value |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| note | 1   |\\n| folder | 2   |\\n| setting | 3   |\\n| resource | 4   |\\n| tag | 5   |\\n| note\\\\_tag | 6   |\\n| search | 7   |\\n| alarm | 8   |\\n| master\\\\_key | 9   |\\n| item\\\\_change | 10  |\\n| note\\\\_resource | 11  |\\n| resource\\\\_local\\\\_state | 12  |\\n| revision | 13  |\\n| migration | 14  |\\n| smart\\\\_filter | 15  |\\n| command | 16  |\\n\\n## Notes[\\u{200b}](#notes \\\"Direct link to Notes\\\")\\n\\n### Properties[\\u{200b}](#properties \\\"Direct link to Properties\\\")\\n\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| id  | text |     |\\n| parent\\\\_id | text | ID of the notebook that contains this note. Change this ID to move the note to a different notebook. |\\n| title | text | The note title. |\\n| body | text | The note body, in Markdown. May also contain HTML. |\\n| created\\\\_time | int | When the note was created. |\\n| updated\\\\_time | int | When the note was last updated. |\\n| is\\\\_conflict | int | Tells whether the note is a conflict or not. |\\n| latitude | numeric |     |\\n| longitude | numeric |     |\\n| altitude | numeric |     |\\n| author | text |     |\\n| source\\\\_url | text | The full URL where the note comes from. |\\n| is\\\\_todo | int | Tells whether this note is a todo or not. |\\n| todo\\\\_due | int | When the todo is due.

The base URL is basically where the HTML was fetched from, minus the query (everything after the '?'). For example if the original page was `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bjava%5D+test`, the base URL is `https://stackoverflow.com/search`. |\\n| image\\\\_data\\\\_url | text | An image to attach to the note, in [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) format. |\\n| crop\\\\_rect | text | If an image is provided, you can also specify an optional rectangle that will be used to crop the image.

Current focus is on secure boot.\\n   Does committee talk about this much?\\n\\nA: It's something we've talked about a little but did not include in\\n   baseline.\\n\\n   Don't run before we can walk... will mostly be looking at EFI secure\\n   boot. A company is implementing EFI secure boot in u-boot but source\\n   it not yet available.\\n   \\n   Want to take care with EBBR to leverage as much as possible existing\\n   standards.\\n\\nQ: Are there any example reference platforms?\\n\\nA: Raspberry Pi, Ultra96, MacciatoBin, QEMU.\\n\\nQ: Some developers are unsure what they need to turn on to make\\n   a u-boot system EBBR compliant.\\n\\nA: SuSE is working on running SCT (self certification tests).\\n\\n   Enable distro-boot and don't explicitly disable anything extra then\\n   you will get all the EFI features.\\n\\nQ: Reality for OEMs is we take u-boot from the upstream vendor. How long\\n   before we expect vendors to pick this up?\\n   \\nA: Hard to answer because different vendors have different timelines for\\n   their SDKs. Expect eventually distros to be a carrot for vendors in\\n   some markets.\\n\\nQ: Are you talking to silicon vendors?\\n\\nA: TI, ST, NXP, Xilinx...\\n\\nQ: One of the requirements in my industry are recovery boots. Does\\n   document contain anything in this area?\\n\\nA: Not yet, planned to tackle after 1.0. Not clear whether this will be\\n   specification or guidance. Current implementations provide enough\\n   bits and pieces to implement fallbacks but there is no guidance.\\n\\nQ: I want to build an operating system and I have had bad experiences\\n   with secure boot on x86. If I don't use secure boot and use x86\\n   will it work? Most users do not know what it is.\\n\\nA: Whether secure boot is enabled will depend on the platform.

I guessed as much.\\nI am just reading Taiten's minutes.\\npaulliu\\tI'll write the current stats of s500 (32-bit) board tomorrow.\\ndanielt\\tOk. Also kernel section on S900 contradicts minutes...\\nAre the kernels you have so far for S500?\\npaulliu\\tok\\ndanielt\\tBTW... I would be interested in your opinions on their request for code scan...\\nWe might have to say \\\"not for a group member\\\" anyway but are they thinking source or binary.\\npaulliu\\tI remember there are some open source tools metioned by OIN.\\ndanielt\\tI'm a bit out of date here... all I remember is Eric Raymond's comparator (which was written when the SCO trials were just starting).\\npaulliu\\tThey are saying source scan. They can give us some sources they have but they don't want to release.\\ndanielt\\tHmnnn... \\nThat's what black duck do.\\nChallenge is having large enough corpus of code to start from.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nHi. What do you mean the kerneo section of S900 contradicts minutes?\\ndanielt\\tIt says 64-bit kernels are already delivered.\\nMinutes say not until tomorrow.\\n(or is it we have S900 kernel but it is running in 32-bit mode?)\\npaulliu\\tYes. It is delievered. But they have new versions which fix some of the problems in the stats.\\ndanielt\\tOk. I see.\\npaulliu\\tI mean, something like \\\"dts out of sourec tree\\\". \\\"include out of source tree stuff\\\". not built.\\ndanielt\\tSo we still wait for a kernel \\\"good enough\\\" to start work.\\n?\\npaulliu\\tyes. But anyway, if we don't have the real hardware, we don't know if the kernel works really.\\ndanielt\\tThat's true.\\npaulliu\\tWe can only try to build it. \\ndanielt\\tBTW they mentioned not sharing git history because they don't want to disclose names of engineers...\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\tDo you think that is the real reason?\\n(can we anonymize)\\nOften its not really why they don't want to... it just sounds OK...\\npaulliu\\tNot the only reason I think. But they are saying it is really confident again today.\\ndanielt\\tAnother reason is usually that code that existed transiently in the tree is confidential.\\nI remember a GFX driver which had a HDCP implementation in its git history if youi dug through it...\\nThat was fun!\\npaulliu\\tWow. That's really fun.\\nSo since their hardware will be ready after 2 weeks. I should work on 32-bit machines first for them. Right? Otherwise they might think we are not working.\\nJust to get used to their process. Not really delivered something.\\ndanielt\\tNot totally sure...\\npaulliu\\tOK.\\nSo we might need to discuss this to Scott? I know 32-bit is out of our scope.\\ndanielt\\tMight be better use of time to start looking at BSP analsysis (categorising new files by what hardware they enable).\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tHowever right now I have queston about what the goal for the analysis would be (will email in response to Taiten soon)\\nFor now follow your instincts on what is most productive. I'm sure this will come up when I talk to Scott this afternoon.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nBut Thomas really wants us to, use their u-boot and kernel right now. And boot into console. Using our tools to make an image. That's all.\\nHe just wants to see that. \\ndanielt\\tAs in start working out how to interate into LAVA?\\nOr earlier steps than that?\\n(Android image or debian image)\\n?\\npaulliu\\tearlier steps then that. Because we've already ask them to modify the u-boot. \\nCurrently I'm giving them Debian images. But for Android isn't a problem right?\\nThey are not going to release their android to us.\\ndanielt\\tThat's fine by me!\\npaulliu\\tBut if we have their u-boot and kernel, we should be able to run plain AOSP on top of it?\\ndanielt\\tAndroid has lots of its own tools. The Linaro android images that use hwpacks etc. are pretty \\\"weird\\\" in android world.\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\tAOSP needs a few out of tree patches to run well.\\npaulliu\\tSo I mean, we have kernel/uboot, and plus our Linaro android images, should that be ok to make a bootable imae?\\nimage.\\ndanielt\\tMost vendors also stick to the same kernel as google (3.10, 3.14 or 3.18 depending on age)\\npaulliu\\tMight be slow. But just boot into the graphical UI.\\ndanielt\\tYes. A mainline kernel can boot AOSP and show unaccelerated graphics on framebuffer.\\npaulliu\\tyes. That's what they want currently.\\nThey don't want to share their hardware accel for android anyway. We won't have them.\\nThey just want a slow android on framebuffer.\\nEven for the s900, they just want an android on framebuffer.\\ndanielt\\tThat might need talking about.\\ndanielt reaches for 96boards spec\\ndanielt\\ttypes a bunch of random characters...\\\"M\\ndanielt\\t\\\"damn acrobat... let me type\\\"\\n\\\"Minimum Software requiresment for 96 boaards cerfication will include:\\n...\\nAccelerate graphics support\\n...\\nAccelerate graphics drivers need to be fully supported either with open soruce code, or through royalty gree binary drivers.\\nLinaro has been offering \\\"grandfather\\\" clauses to some vendors w.r.t. certifcation but unless we have agreed to waive this then I'm not sure keeping GFX drivers from us is OK.\\npaulliu\\thi..\\ndanielt\\tHowever they don't have to give source.\\npaulliu\\tI think pasting is bad.\\ndanielt\\tIt was.\\nI started typing maunally after the \\\"damn acrobat\\\" comment.\\npaulliu\\thmm...\\nOK.

ARM Trusted Firmware is licensed using 3-clause BSD; proprietary\\n   derivatives are permitted by ARM (and other licensors).\\n\\n5. hiboot is derived from u-boot.\\n\\n6. u-boot is licensed under GNU GPL; no proprietary derivatives are\\n   permitted by the licensors.\\n\\n7. hiboot is a 32-bit code base and *after* loading BL31 and BL33 \\n   it does a warm reset to switch to 64-bit mode and run the\\n   payloaads.\\n\\n8. hiboot currently integrates binary blobs, in particular auxcode,\\n   into u-boot (start.S).\\n \\n9. HiSi prefer that the source code to some of the binary blobs\\n   not be disclosed.\\n\\nPlans\\n-----\\n\\n1. Linaro (SSE) will develop implementations of BL1/BL2 derived from\\n   the reference implementations in ARM TF (and some of the binary\\n   blobs in hiboot). BL1 will be augmented, using a scheme similar to\\n   Hikey l-loader, to integrate both the switch from 32- to 64-bit mode\\n   and any HiSi specific 32-bit code to configure the device.\\n\\n2. Linaro (SSE) will use the existing ARM TF implementation as\\n   the BL31 payload. Beyond reconfiguring it to disable the\\n   direct-to-BL31 option Linaro expect to make no changes to \\n   this component. We expect HiSi to own and maintain this.\\n\\n5. Linaro (SSE) will use u-boot (2017 version) as the BL33 payload and \\n   seek to add sufficient drivers to u-boot that it may be useful to \\n   boot/update the normal (non-secure) world OS (Linux).\\n\\n6. Linaro (Aspen) will continue development of the new kernel using\\n   hiboot. It is expected that little or no kernel changes will be\\n   needed to transition to the changes to BL1/BL2/BL33.\\n\\n7. HiSi will continue development on UEFI using hiboot. It is\\n   expected UEFI can be used as a BL33 payload once the above is\\n   delivered with little or no changes.\\n\\n8. #1 above may require access to detailed knowledge held by HiSi,\\n   especially regarding behavior of the poplar boot ROM. HiSi agree to\\n   provide appropriate window-persons as needed.\\n   \\nRemaining unknowns\\n------------------\\n\\n1. During Monday meeting no-one present understood how secondary\\n   cores are booted. Linaro request diagram of boot process for\\n   secondary cores to establish if BL1 code need provide support\\n   for secondary cores to boot.\\n\\n2. Allowing poplar to use standards confirming partition tables for\\n   eMMC is desirable. Further discussion on this topic is deferred\\n   until we progress further with the above (HiSi may progress this\\n   independently within UEFI).\\n\\n3. Basic JTAG facilities (extract PC, peek, poke, etc) would\\n   significantly reduce Linaro development effort.\\n   \\n   a. Poplar uses a non-standard JTAG connector. Linaro request HiSi \\n      provide adapter cables to allow standard 2x10 (or maybe 2x5) JTAG\\n      adapters to be used.\\n\\n   b. Linaro request access to config scripts used by HiSi to connect\\n      poplar to their JTAG debuggers.\\n\" }\n",

      "NoteBody { id: \"41361e944f65498eadfcb773a9b2dfdd\", body: \"<h1>Debugging ARM kernels using fast interrupts</h1>\\n\\n<p>Recently things have pretty quiet for the interactive kernel debug\\ntools, with kgdb and kdb combined receiving only four patches in the\\nlast year. However activity has starting to pick up as new work inspired\\nby Android's out-of-tree debugger, fiq_debugger, has been posted for\\nconsideration. One of the key features proposed increases the robustness\\nof these tools by making it much harder for bugs in the system under\\ntest to prevent the user invoking the debugger.</p>\\n\\n<p>Both kgdb and kdb have been included in the kernel for a long time.\\n<a href=\\\"http://landley.net/kdocs/Documentation/DocBook/xhtml-nochunks/kgdb.html#EnableKGDB\\\">kgdb</a>,\\na debug stub that allows another machine to connect a source level\\ndebugger to is using a serial link, was merged in 2.6.26 while <a href=\\\"http://landley.net/kdocs/Documentation/DocBook/xhtml-nochunks/kgdb.html#usingKDB\\\">kdb</a>,\\nafter a significant rewrite, was merged into 2.6.37. The rewrite\\nallowed kdb to reuse kgdb's breakpoint and polled I/O infrastructure in \\norder to implement a machine-level kernel debugger that runs entirely \\non the machine under debug.</p>\\n\\n<p>On a PC the main distinction between kdb and kgdb is that kdb can be\\noperated from the PC's own keyboard and display. This difference is less\\nobvious on embedded systems which seldom have their own keyboard.\\nHowever the property is retained. kdb is self hosting, requiring only a\\nterminal emulator, while kgdb requires a machine loaded up with the\\ndeveloper tools and the corresponding vmlinux file.</p>\\n\\n<p>Both these debug tools share common infrastructure and both also\\nshare a limitation; there are circumstances where other parts of the\\nkernel can mask interrupts, including the one from the serial port,\\nmaking it impossible for the user to manually stop the machine to debug\\nit. When this happens the request to stop the system never makes it from\\nthe serial port to the processor. As good example of this occurs if\\n<tt>spin_lock_irq()</tt> is used incorrectly by a faulty driver causing\\na deadlock that cannot be studied with the debugger.</p>\\n\\n<h4>ARM's fast interrupt (FIQ) support</h4>\\n\\n<p>The ARM architecture includes two means to interrupt the processor,\\nthe normal interrupt (IRQ) and the fast interrupt (FIQ). The two forms\\nof interrupt have separate block bits within the ARMs processor status\\nregister and Linux code seldom, if ever, sets the FIQ block bit. The\\nprocessor also implements special features to reduce the overhead of FIQ\\nhandling. For example it deploys special register banking during FIQ\\nhandling, and the FIQ vector is carefully placed within the exception\\nvector table so its handler can be directly executed (all other ARM\\nexceptions must JMP due to lack of space in the vector table). This\\nmeans a FIQ handler, if specially crafted to use only a few registers,\\nneed not save or restore any state.  The combination of seldom being\\nmasked, reduced demux overhead (because few drivers employ FIQ), and\\nadditional hardware features combine to give fast interrupts their\\nname.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the CPU level the ARM's FIQ signal is technically very similar to\\nthe x86 non-maskable interrupt (NMI) but its role within the system\\narchitecture has different historical roots. ARM FIQs were, as the name\\nsuggests, designed to rapidly service demanding peripherals or even to\\nallow software to replace hardware (for example in synchronous serial\\ncommunication). This contrasts strongly with the PC world the NMI has\\nlong been associated with diagnostics and other troubleshooting\\ntechniques.  NMI was originally used in the IBM PC to report hardware\\nfaults such memory parity errors. Today watchdogs built into PC\\nchipsets signal failure using NMI and server systems may even include a\\nphysical NMI button that can be used to provoke diagnostic features.</p>\\n\\n<p>Most ARM systems have interrupt controllers that allows any interrupt\\nsource to be routed either to IRQ or FIQ. Occasionally in embedded\\nARM/Linux systems this facility it used for its original purpose of\\nsupporting a single peripheral with very aggressive latency\\nrequirements. For example the Raspberry Pi kernel uses FIQ to improve\\nUSB performance. However it is much more common for the FIQ never to be\\nused at all! This makes it possible to route the UART interrupt to FIQ,\\nimproving the robustness of communication between the UART and the\\ndebugger. Since the FIQ is never masked a faulty driver would no longer\\nbe able to prevent the debugger operating normally simply by disabling\\ninterrupts.</ p>\\n\\n<h4>Android's fiq_debugger</h4>\\n\\n<p>Google's android team have already implemented an interactive\\ndebugger which can, optionally, take advantage of FIQ interrupts.\\nfiq_debugger has a long history dating back several years before kdb\\nwas merged in to kernel. Recently it was used to develop many of\\nGoogle's Nexus line of phones and tablets. On\\nthese devices the UART is connected either to the\\n<a href=\\\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1461986\\\">USB</a>\\nor\\n<a href=\\\"http://blog.accuvant.com/jduckandryan/building-a-nexus-4-uart-debug-cable/\\\">headphone</a>\\nsockets. These UARTs are disabled during normal use but become active\\nwhen presence detect resisters indicate that something is\\nlistening to the UART.</p>\\n\\n<p>On devices whose application processors can support it fiq_debugger\\nreceived and processes all user input and executes the majority of\\ncommands from the FIQ handler. This makes it extremely robust against\\ndriver bugs that leave the system unresponsive although there are some\\ndrawbacks. In particular FIQ can interrupt the kernel at more or less \\nany point during kernel execution, including during critical sections. \\nThat means that certain debug commands cannot execute safely from the \\nFIQ handler because they might conflict with the interrupted activity.\\nWhen running a FIQ handler even taking a spin lock can lead to lock up\\nif the spin lock is held by an interrupted critical section.</p>\\n\\n<p>To solve this fiq_debugger can drop into normal interrupt handling using\\nARM's software interrupt feature. This allows but extremely robust basic\\ncommands (such as single CPU stack trace) to be implemented alongside\\nmuch richer but slightly less robust status reporting features within the\\nsame debugger.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some ARM systems do not permit routing of the UART interrupt\\nfrom IRQ to FIQ. On these systems the Android debugger remains useful \\nto study a variety of system failures. However it cannot retain the \\nrobustness of the FIQ based systems.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the FIQ support fiq_debugger contains some other\\nunusual features that distinguish it from the existing in-kernel debug\\ntechnologies. These features are motivated by the relatively hostile\\nenvironment the debugger might be deployed in.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\n    <li><p>The UART (and the associated presence detect circuit) might\\n    be presented with\\n    <a href=\\\"http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1323496/focus=1323516\\\">significant noise</a>\\n    due to the serial port being multiplexed with other activity. Noise must\\n    not cause the device to spuriously stop the world.</p></li>\\n\\n    <li><p>The debugger may be deployed on devices with one or more external\\n    hardware watchdogs standing by ready to reset the system should it\\n    become stalled for any reason.</p></li>\\n\\n    <li><p>The debugger may be deployed on production devices and cannot\\n    be used as a means to compromise user privacy. For example a hostile\\n    charging station or airline headphone service must not be able to\\n    access private user data.</p></li>\\n    \\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Fiq_debugger has two features to counter these issues.</p>\\n\\n<p>Firstly fiq_debugger's command interpreter is asynchronous. All CPUs\\ncontinue to run while commands are received from the user and even\\nduring command processing only the CPU fielding the interrupt will be\\ndiverted from normal processing. This contrasts strongly with kdb which\\nis a stop-the-world debugger. As soon as kdb is invoked all CPUs in the\\nsystem are brought to a halt and the system will not resume normal\\nprocessing until the user issues a 'go' command. Stop-the-world has many\\nadvantages, in particular the system cannot change state while the user\\nis reasoning about it, however if the world were stopped accidentally\\ndue to noise (for example when inserting headphones) then this looks to\\nthe user as though the phone had crashed. In this situation the\\nwatchdog will come to the rescue of the normal user but at a terrible\\ncost. If a developer actually wants to stop the world then they will\\nfind that the device resets ten seconds after they started debugging it \\nbecause the watchdog fired. An asynchronous implementation keeps both \\nusers happy.</p>\\n\\n<p>Secondly, fiq_debugger supports only a fairly limited set of built-in\\ncommands. There are no general memory inspection commands and, apart\\nfrom magic-sysrq and reboot, there is no means to divert the device\\nfrom normal processing. The idea is that the passive inspection commands\\nthat do exist (stack trace, process list, irq status, dmesg, register\\ndump) give a reasonable chance of performing successful post-mortem\\nanalysis without much risk of leaking the user's private data.</p>\\n\\n<p>The fiq_debugger, like kdb, offers a command which switches to kgdb\\nmode and enables both arbitrary memory access and traditional\\nstop-the-world step/breakpoint debugging. This command is disabled by\\ndefault and can only be enabled by the root user.</p>\\n\\n<p>Despite its interesting and unique features it seems unlikely that\\nfiq_debugger will be merged to the kernel because its functionality\\noverlaps so significantly with that of kdb.</p>\\n\\n<h4>Improving kgdb/kdb</h4>\\n\\n<p>Inspired by the Android team's work on their debugger Anton Vorontsov of\\nLinaro developed a series of patches to implement some of the best ideas\\nfrom fiq_debugger within kdb. This includes the NMI/FIQ patchset and \\nthe reduced capability series.</p>\\n\\n<p>The NMI/FIQ patchset introduced a generic framework to support NMI based\\ndebuggers together with a concrete implementation for ARM based on FIQ.\\nThe framework allows both kgdb and kdb to be triggered from nonmaskable\\ninterrupts bringing the robustness of nonmaskable debuggers to all\\nin-kernel debug technologies.</p>\\n\\n<p>The\\n<a href=\\\"http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1363754\\\">generic framework</a>\\nprovides a means for the NMI handler to deliver\\ncharacters to a special TTY driver which interacts with a real serial\\nport driver using its polled I/O interfaces. The TTY driver allows the\\nuser to invoke kdb (or kgdb) but takes steps to avoid spuriously \\nstopping the world due to noise by requiring a special \\\"knock\\\" to stop \\nthe system.</p>\\n\\n<p>The generic framework was\\n<a href=\\\"https://lwn.net/Articles/520001/\\\">merged into 3.7</a> but\\nunfortunately the ARM specific patches to take advantage of it never\\nwere able to get reviewer or maintainer attention despite multiple\\nsubmissions.

It\\nworks well with multi-arch kernels although Russell King has\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334390.html\\\">identified some potential issues</a>\\ndue to changes that require spin locks to be avoided within one of the \\ninterrupt controller callbacks. In the device tree portion of the patch \\nSrinivas Kandagatla\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334383.html\\\">asked for better documentation</a>\\nof the new device tree bindings and Russell King has\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg334391.html\\\">serious concerns</a>\\nabout how FIQ capable interrupt signals are described within device \\ntree interrupt map. Finally Colin Cross, one of the developers of\\nAndroid's fiq_debugger, has\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1676608/focus=1692875\\\">previously noted</a>\\nthe need for additional changes to kgdb to fully benefit from FIQ on SMP\\nplatforms. In particular the current code to stop-the-world uses an \\ninter-processor IRQ to stop the other processors which should be made\\nto use FIQ to fully benefit from the robustness improvements.</p>\\n\\n<p>Supplementing the NMI/FIQ patchset is the\\n<a href=\\\"http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1697818\\\">reduced capability patchset</a>\\nwhich a means to restrict which classes of kdb commands can be used \\nduring a debug session. The permitted commands are set at boot and can \\nmodified by the root user while the system is running. This allows kdb \\nto be setup with a similar range of commands to fiq_debugger although \\nother combinations are also possible and can be used to target \\ndifferent use-cases.</p>\\n\\n<h4>The impact of TrustZone on FIQ</h4>\\n\\n<p>In the above text we have assumed that the interrupt controller\\nprovides a means route the UART interrupt to the processor's FIQ signal\\nand that this signal is observable by the kernel. Unfortunately, for\\nmodern ARM systems that implement TrustZone this is not always the\\ncase.</p>\\n\\n<p><a\\nhref=\\\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.prd29-genc-009492c/index.html\\\">TrustZone</a>\\nis a security technology for ARM. It works by dividing the processor into\\ntwo virtual processors each of which is considered to occupy a different\\n\\\"world\\\". Peripherals, including processor-intimate peripherals such as\\nthe interrupt controller, can determine which world a memory access\\noriginates from. This is used to implement hardware based controls that\\nprevent the \\\"normal world\\\" virtual processor from interfering with the\\noperation of the \\\"secure world\\\".</p>\\n\\n<p>ARM systems with TrustZone do not introduce new interrupt signals \\nbetween the interrupt controller and the processor. Instead the\\nprocessor will switch automatically from normal world to trusted world\\nin response to the FIQ signal, meaning only the IRQ signal can be used by\\nan operating system running in normal world. The interrupt controller\\nsupports this division by treating memory access to the FIQ routing \\nregisters from normal world read-as-zero/write-ignored.</p>\\n\\n<p>In typical systems that employ TrustZone the secure monitor is booted\\nfrom a tamper resistant bootloader and the kernel later booted in normal\\nworld. The kernel can interact with the secure monitor using a special\\nSecure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction which operates in a similar manner\\nto a system call.</p>\\n\\n<p>This means that a developer, working on a kernel running in \\\"normal\\nworld\\\" must rely on cooperation from the secure monitor to help pass FIQ\\nsignals to the kernel. Unfortunately features to support this are not\\nyet standardized and implemented in currently available secure monitors.\\nThankfully there are projects like\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware\\\">ARM trusted firmware</a>\\nfrom ARM itself and the\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-forms-security-working-group/\\\">work on trusted execution enviroments</a>\\nby Linaro, STMicroelectronics and NVIDIA to provide us with open source \\ninfrastructure to prototype and develop interfaces between the kernel \\nand the secure monitor. This should eventually open up the opportunity \\nfor developers to employ NMI-like debug techniques on almost all modern \\nARM systems.</p>\\n\\n<h4>What is coming next?</h4>\\n\\n<p>The NMI/FIQ patchset is relatively small but conceals within it some\\nfairly significant behavioural changes. Not content with proposing big\\nchanges to the default configuration of one of ARM's most commom\\ninterrupt controllers, it also causes all of the debugger code to run\\nfrom a non-maskable interrupt handler thus imposing new restrictions on the\\nuse of spin locks within the debugger implementation. This means a good \\nbit of testing may be required in order to gain sufficient confidence \\nfor the patches to be merged.</p>\\n\\n<p>Many types of testing are needed, from simple does-it-still-boot\\nregression testing right through to deliberately breaking the kernel and\\nchecking that the debugger can still be invoked. For example, running \\nthese tests on SMP systems will reveal the limitations of the kgdb code \\nto stop-the-world and allow us to fix this.</p>\\n\\n<p>To encourage wider testing a port to the BeagleBone Black is planned\\nalthough progress here has been frustrated slightly by the\\n<a href=\\\"http://beagleboard.org/blog/2014-04-13-dude-wheres-my-beaglebone-black/\\\">worldwide shortage of boards</a>.\\nIn the mean time be aware that porting to a new board can be as little\\nas 31 lines of code if the interrupt controller is already supported.\\nThis makes porting to other development boards a terrific way for an \\ninterested developer to get involved with this work.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of the above means that, while it is too late for anything to\\nhappen in the 3.16 merge window, we can hope to see at least some of \\nthe patches making their way into 3.17.</p>\\n\\n<h4>ChangeLog</h4>\\n\\n<p>Since third revision:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\n    <li><p>Fix inverted description of the ARM mask bits.

Try spreadtrum tree in my side.\\n[10:26:17] Yin Fengwei: 2. get the AOSP base. apply LCR patches, then apply Spreadtrum patches.\\n[10:26:36] danielthompson-rfn: So during #2 you will find out if the binaries in the release cause any problem?\\n[10:26:36] Yin Fengwei: There is one issue: the AOSP base of LCR and Spreadtrum tree are different\\n[10:26:42] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[10:26:43] danielthompson-rfn: How different?\\n[10:27:15] Yin Fengwei: According to Spreadtrum engineer, that binary should be big problem. And I could seek his help once I see problem with the binary.\\n[10:27:37] Yin Fengwei: LCR is based on android-5.1.1_r4 and Spreadtrum tree is based on android-5.1.1_r2\\n[10:28:10] Yin Fengwei: No idea whether this difference could bring us big problem. I'd like to try first.\\n[10:28:13] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. So difference is (roughly speaking) bug/performance fix only.\\n[10:28:43] danielthompson-rfn: That's fine. Like many things. Best way to find problems is to do it and see what breaks.\\n[10:28:45] Yin Fengwei: Not exactly. As I know, there could be big changes introduced between r2/r3/r4.\\n[10:28:58] Yin Fengwei: Yes. That's my plan. :)>\\n[10:29:39] danielthompson-rfn: Just to double check... after fixing the SSH issues you now have (very slow) access to LCR-M?\\n[10:29:45] Yin Fengwei: I checked the patches from Spreadtrum and I suppsoe some patches could be dropped. Especially the patch for debugging.\\n[10:29:51] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[10:30:20] Yin Fengwei: Actually very slow access to linaro private git server (because Spreadtrum tree is in this server too).\\n[10:30:50] Yin Fengwei: There is another changes related with LCR.\\n[10:31:14] Yin Fengwei: LCR replaced the art and build directory with linaro's version.\\n[10:31:31] Yin Fengwei: ART should be OK because Spreadtrum just has one patch for ART (to enable core dump).\\n[10:31:45] Yin Fengwei: But they have several patches for build tree.\\n[10:32:15] Yin Fengwei: So appling build patches of spreadtrum to LCR could be a challange.\\n[10:32:15] danielthompson-rfn: LCR *replaces* the build directory?\\n[10:32:19] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[10:32:21] danielthompson-rfn: Ouch.\\n[10:32:43] danielthompson-rfn: I knew if created a special linaro directory but isn't it optional to use it?\\n[10:33:08] Yin Fengwei: I checked the local manifest and saw it removed the old build directory.\\n[10:33:35] Yin Fengwei: I didn't get the full LCR source yet.\\n[10:33:45] Yin Fengwei: Will know exactly once I have full LCR source.\\n[10:34:54] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. Double check the history of the build repo that is replacing the AOSP one (maybe it is derived from AOSP with changes).\\n[10:35:05] danielthompson-rfn: If it looks \\\"bad\\\" then start conversation on ML.\\n[10:35:06] Yin Fengwei: Yes. That's my plan.\\n[10:35:16] Yin Fengwei: OK. I will.\\n[10:35:42] danielthompson-rfn: How do you plan to divide time between member build and Qcom WiFi?\\n[10:36:30] Yin Fengwei: I could work on Qcom Wifi before the Spreadtrum/LCR code is ready.\\n[10:37:36] Yin Fengwei: The Qcom Wifi work is not very urgent now. I grant Spreadtrum work higher priority.\\n[10:38:22] Yin Fengwei: And build android takes long time (3 hours for 64bit android in my side because it needs build both 64bit and 32bit libs).\\n[10:38:26] danielthompson-rfn: Great. I agree Spreadtrum work is (a little) more important... am OK if you choose to interleave a little bit to keep QCom work ticking over.\\n[10:38:36] Yin Fengwei: I could work on Qcom wifi when build android code.\\n[10:38:50] danielthompson-rfn: Ok.\\n[10:39:08] danielthompson-rfn: So... last thing on my list is reporting work.\\n[10:39:25] Yin Fengwei: So two tasks together should be OK. More than two will be problem. :).\\n[10:39:34] danielthompson-rfn: :-)\\n[10:39:57] danielthompson-rfn: You've seen that I have been making lots of changes to cards (all the Plans/Progress).\\n[10:40:06] Yin Fengwei: Yes.\\n[10:40:50] danielthompson-rfn: Right now I have a script that drags comments and work logs from JIRA (both blueprints and cards) and also from engineering status report (cards only) and formats it.\\n[10:41:04] danielthompson-rfn: It's working well and Jason L. rather likes using worklogs for this.\\n[10:41:27] Yin Fengwei: OK. I get it.\\n[10:41:29] danielthompson-rfn: Hence I have been copying bits of peoples weeklies into blueprint worklogs to check things out.\\n[10:41:39] danielthompson-rfn: If you want to join in with this then great!\\n[10:41:45] Yin Fengwei: Sure.\\n[10:42:03] danielthompson-rfn: Idea is you can just report in the worklog of the card or blueprint that best fits what you are working on.\\n[10:42:08] Yin Fengwei: Just let me know how.\\n[10:42:23] danielthompson-rfn: Script picks out \\\"h2. Plans\\\" and \\\"h2. Progress\\\" for the titles.\\n[10:42:54] danielthompson-rfn: Rest of information maps paragraphs (where paragraph is delimited by two new lines) into bullet points.\\n[10:42:58] Yin Fengwei: OK. From comments? Or from engineer update?\\n[10:43:05] danielthompson-rfn: All of them...\\n[10:43:13] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[10:43:23] Yin Fengwei: Is there an example I could check?\\n[10:43:33] danielthompson-rfn: However recommendation is to use Work log. Select \\\"Log work, invent a time (I use 1m), and enter work on that card.\\n[10:44:36] danielthompson-rfn: For examples, see PS-52 -> Work log.\\n[10:45:00] Yin Fengwei: OK. Let me check.\\n[10:45:08] danielthompson-rfn: BTW I will tidy up script a little and share with you...\\n[10:45:25] Yin Fengwei: OK. Thanks. I will try it once I get it.\\n[10:45:44] danielthompson-rfn: It means you can generate a *template* of your weekly report from JIRA (then add any details for \\\"misc\\\" reporting, like memcpy() bug before you send).\\n[10:46:01] Yin Fengwei: OK.\\n[10:46:13] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. Also *please* report any problems. I don't want to impose bad process on anyone.\\n[10:46:32] Yin Fengwei: So update the JIRA with format. And generate the weekly report using the script. Am I right?\\n[10:46:37] Yin Fengwei: Sure.\\n[10:47:07] danielthompson-rfn: Yes... but I need to change script so it filters out unwanted info (currently it generates for whole team).\\n[10:47:10] Yin Fengwei: I am checking PS-52 and kind of clear to me now.\\n[10:47:34] danielthompson-rfn: At the moment the \\\"time spent\\\" can have any value you like!\\n[10:47:38] Yin Fengwei: OK. Thanks.\\n[10:48:26] danielthompson-rfn: So... that's all from me... I've not got any WiFi questions this week!\\n[10:48:34] danielthompson-rfn: ANything else your side?\\n[10:48:46] Yin Fengwei: No from my side.\\n[10:49:07] danielthompson-rfn: Ok. Then I shall see you next week!\\n\\n\" }\n",

Can't think of any reason\\n     not to push for 3D first; with glamor (2D using OpenGL) it is\\n     unlikely that the Bubblegum-96 2D hardware will need to be\\n     enabled.\\n   - Started to update the existing kernel analysis from June (and\\n     wow... isn't checkpatch.pl a  pain with modern perl\\n   - Completed review and shared internally.\\n   - Right now it is very unclear to me how Linaro-supported kernels\\n     will work for 96Boards. That is a blocker for sharing this work\\n     with Actions Semi.\\n\\n * Actions: Bubblegum-96 pre-release engineering activity [Paul]\\n   (PSE-42)\\n   - Push kernel to public git tree. Removed touchscreen driver. Help\\n     setting up the CI. Now the results can be found on  http://builds\\n     .96boards.org/snapshots/bubblegum/linaro/linux/latest/ Made a\\n     boot.img by CI results.\\n   - Push u-boot git to public git tree. Apply some patches that is\\n     needed for the de-brick tools. Help setting up the CI builds. The\\n     results are http://builds.96boards.org/snapshots/bubblegum/linaro\\n     /u-boot/latest/ Manually generate boot.img by the CI results.\\n   - Help and patching the config file for generating developers\\n     Debian image for CI. The results are http://builds.96boards.org/s\\n     napshots/bubblegum/linaro/linux/latest/ The emmc.img can be\\n     flashed to the SYSTEM partition and works good.\\n   - U-boot packaging completed. The results can be found on\\n     http://repo.linaro.org/ubuntu/linaro-staging/pool/main/u/u-boot-\\n     linaro-bubblegum96/ This is needed for l-m-c and users who wants\\n     to update/flash latest u-boot.\\n\\n\\n * Actions: OpenOCD support for Bubblegum-96 [Daniel] (PSE-5)\\n\\n * Actions: Provisioning/debrick tools for Bubblegum-96 [Paul] (PSE-8)\\n   - Refined the code. Using cmake to generate Makefile. Let the tool\\n     to read data from proper directory. Add Actions license to data\\n     directory.\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Hisilicon D02 kernel /lib modules, firmwares packaging\\n   and installation support for distributions [Paul] (PSE-1)\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Upgrade MCU firmware and stub clock driver [Leo]\\n   (PSE-24)\\n   - Rebased topic branch topic/hikey-tracking-pm with kernel 4.4-rc3.\\n\\n * Linaro: EAS and IPA familiarization [Leo] (PSE-6)\\n   - Tried to enable test-toolkit (ARM's EAS automatic testing FW) for\\n     Hikey; with some hacking now ssh/scp can work well, and can\\n     recognize Hikey with 2 LITTLE clusters. Also sent email to\\n     Patrick for confirm for this.\\n   - Enabled EAS automatic testing framework test-toolkit on Hikey\\n     board, and found several bugs for ftrace module in dev-lib. With\\n     these fixing, now can run successfully on Hikey. And reported\\n     these issues to ARM. Still leave one feature is to enable power\\n     meter (ARM energy probe).\\n   - Wrote patch for spreading tasks with lower OPP and send to EAS-\\n     dev mailing list for review. After profiling, the result is not\\n     good enough, the mainly reason is the energy calculation is not\\n     as expected so it still will pack tasks into one CPU. Need\\n     investigate further more.\\n   - Enabled IPA on Hikey board, but directly used Juno's power model\\n     data. From roughly testing with sysbench, IPA has much better\\n     control effect than step-wise governor. Also sent email to ARM to\\n     confirm the power modeling method for IPA and got some feedback.\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (PSE-7)\\n\\n * MediaTek: Upstream training for MediaTek [Leo] (PSE-12)\\n   - Took two days' travelling to Taiwan for Mediatek tranining. In\\n     first day, delivered advanced upstream training; and in second\\n     day gave some consultancy with KC Liu for ARM-TF's detailed flow,\\n     context switching, interrupt handling. etc. Also discussed for\\n     later's training for ARM-TF, OP-TEE, EAS etc.\\n\\n * MediaTek: Audio driver BSP analaysis and upstreaming consultancy\\n   [Daniel] (PSE-25)\\n\\n * MediaTek: MT8173 DRM and V4L2 public code review [Daniel] (PSE-40)\\n   - Exchanged several more (public) mails with MediaTek engineers.\\n   - Was forced to be very specific regarding the shortcomings of the\\n     V4L2 patches.\\n   - Developer replies suggest they lack experience on subjects like\\n     SMP satefy (but we will see).\\n\\n * Qualcomm: WiFi and BT for DragonBoard 410c [Fengwei] (PSE-13)\\n   - The script was updated not to created the macaddr file\\n     unconditionally. Because the same file system image could be used\\n     on other 96board. The new script only create macaddr file if\\n     wcnss is activied and the file is created before the driver try\\n     to read mac addr from it.\\n   - The script was merged to Debian distribution and the ticket could\\n     be closed.\\n   - From Qualcomm side: They tried the DragonBoard in chamber. And\\n     got almost same throughput as mine which is about 40Mbps with\\n     both android and linux distribution. Much lower than they got\\n     with MTP platform. They will check in their side.\\n   - They also hit the problem that iperf data was not stable with\\n     Linux distribution while stable with android. In my side, if I\\n     use Linux distribution, whatever the prima driver or upstream\\n     driver, the throughput both are not stable.\\n   - Could reproduce the issue reliable by git clone the git tree on\\n     Linaro git server with http/https protocol.\\n   - Tried git clone by git protocol, issue can't be triggered.\\n   - The direct reason for crash is the DMA data is corrupt. Which\\n     presents driver a very big skb packet and skb_put detect this\\n     issue and panic system.\\n   - Changed the code to add 32 bytes head/tail buffer to each skb and\\n     clear the head/tail buffer to all zero. Checking them after the\\n     crash happen showed these buffer is not zero when issue\\n     happening. It's more like the buffer was wrongly updated.\\n   - The issue was root caused as an issue in wcn36xx wifi driver.\\n     When driver get rx interrupt, it will allocate the new rx skb and\\n     queue old rx skb to network upper layer. But if the rx skb\\n     allocation is failed, the old skb will be used for DMA again\\n     because there is no new rx skb for it. So it could corrupt the\\n     memory and trigger kernel crash.\\n   - The fix is not to queue rx skb to network upper layer once the\\n     new rx skb allocation fails. It's like dropping current packet.\\n     With patch, git clone is OOMed now (instead of system crash). OOM\\n     is the signal that system is in extremely memory shortage\\n     situation.\\n   - With zram (500M size) or swap on sd card, I could run git clone\\n     without any problem. Test in my side looks promised (I could do\\n     more than 10 cycle git clone/rm without any problem).\\n   - The test in reporter side (he used patch + swap on sd card)\\n     didn't trigger system crash by wifi driver. But he trigger\\n     another crash which is in slub (kernel common code). I am asking\\n     the report more information about it.\\n   - Sent the fixing patch to wcn36xx mail list for review. No\\n     response yet.\\n   - We believe the issue that wifi throughput drop and back\\n     periodically is related with software scan implemented in wcn36xx\\n     driver. From the kernel mac80211 implementatoin, when software\\n     scan is active, all tranfic on all channel needs be stopped. And\\n     wpa_supplicant of Linux distribution does scan periodically. I\\n     asked whether Qualcomm could try iwconfig/iw to connect to open\\n     AP instead of using wpa_supplicant. So we could confirm. No\\n     feedback yet.\\n   - At the same time, we are planning to enable HW scan for wcn36xx.\\n     We already got some documents could help on HW scan enabling. We\\n     could start working on it once we have time.\\n\\n * ST: Consultancy to support LAVA evaluation [Esla] (PSE-36)\\n\\n * Socionext: EAS/IPA training [Leo] (PSE-49)\\n   - Reviewed the IPA slides from ARM and the power allocator governor\\n     in the  kernel.\\n   - There is quite a gulf between the slides and the realization.\\n     Slides are not wrong, just contain very little practical\\n     information.\\n   - devfreq based cooling device will appear in v4.4\\n   - Joined meeting with Socionext to discuss their concerns.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Discussion with Spreadtrum about EAS's power modeling\\n   [Leo] (PSE-46)\\n   - Took 2.5 hours to discuss with Spreadtrum team for EAS's power\\n     modeling, mainly went through slides of \\\"EAS profiling on\\n     Hikey.pdf\\\".\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Spreadtrum member build for TSharkT ARM64 board\\n   [Fengwei] (PSE-9)\\n\\n * TI: Introduce LTP-DDT to the 96Boards CI loop.

Here need note the the\\n  script uses the uart ttyUSB0 by default, need change to proper port\\n  on your PC.\\n\\n  Step 2: after all images burn successfully, switch \\\"Boot mode\\\" to\\n  \\n  Step 3: You can use \\\"reset\\\" button to reset board, the tricky thing\\n  is after reset the board, the first time the board will be forced to\\n  enter fastboot mode in booting FW; this is helpful to give chance to\\n  burn boot.img and dt.img;\\n\\n  If you continue to reset the board, the second time the board will\\n  boot with normal flow and will run into kernel.\\n\\n OFF state.\\n~~~\\n\\nWARNING: It may take a lot of attempts to achieve a successful\\n         debrick...\\n\\n## From Leo\\n\\n~~~\\n- There mainly have two repos:\\n\\n  The FW and the scripts for burning images:\\n  https://github.com/96boards-hikey/tools-images-hikey960\\n\\n  I saw Guodong have all patches into to kernel branch :\\n  https://github.com/96boards-hikey/linux/commits/android-hikey-linaro-4.4\\n\\n  When I enable PM, I use kernel branch:\\n  https://github.com/96boards-hikey/linux/tree/working-hikey960-1208-base-android\\n  I'm sure this branch can work, but have not tried Guodong's branch\\n  android-hikey-linaro-4.4.\\n\\n- Build kernel image:\\n\\n  Use tools-images-hikey960/gen_boot_dts_imgs-sample.sh to build\\n  kernel.\\n\\n  Before use this building script, need manually change below\\n  variables for your local enviornment:\\n  KERNEL_DIR\\n  GEN_IMAGES_DIR\\n  CROSS_COMPILE\\n\\n  For kernel config file, it generates by below command:\\n  make distclean\\n  ARCH=arm64 scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m arch/arm64/configs/defconfig android/configs/android-base.cfg android/configs/android-recommended.cfg\\n\\n  So when firstly I run this script, I found the building will report\\n  the error for the kernel config. I need manully use \\\"make\\n  menuconfig\\\" with a new terminal and \\\"make menuconfig\\\" helps to\\n  correct some missed configurations. After that, I comment out the\\n  upper two sentences from script due we have a existed .config in\\n  kernel folder.\\n\\n  Then it will build kernel image.\\n\\n- Burn kernel image and dt image:\\n\\n  sudo fastboot flash boot boot.img; sudo fastboot flash dts dt.img; sudo fastboot reboot\\n\\n- I usually only use one mini ramdisk as rootfs:\\n  http://people.linaro.org/~leo.yan/hikey960/ramdisk.img\\n\\n  Place this file into folder tools-images-hikey960, and it will be\\n  used for boot.img.\\n\\nThanks,\\nLeo Yan\\n~~~\\n\" }\n",

Mix 2 Cups of Flour, 1 cup of starter and 1 cup water in the bowl of your stand mixer bowl.  Just use a spoon and mix it up.  No needing necessary.  This should be pretty loose\\n2. Cover with wrap and allow to sit overnight\\n\\nNext Day… \\n\\n3. Drop the bowl on your stand mixer and add ½ cup sourdough starter and salt\\n4. Depending on how “wet” your starter is, slowly add about 1 Cup flour while mixing with the dough hook till it pulls away and you're getting a good dough.   The dough should not be sticky, should be soft and springy.   Depending on your ratio for starter, how dry your flour is, etc..  This is something you do by eye & touch.  Too wet and you get flat bagels. \\n5. Let it rest for 15 mins\\n6. Divide the dough into 8 - 10 equal pieces, then shape each piece into a ball.\\n7. Make Bagels (Use silicon molds or pinch in the middle and swing it around your finger… anyway works)\\n8. Rise about 1 - 2 hrs, depending o....n proofing temp. They should be about be puffy\\n9. Preheat the oven to 425°F .\\n10. Boil: Fill a stock pot with water and mix in with Baking Soda. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop the bagels in making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side (2 mins per side if you want a chewier bagel). \\n11. Place bagels onto a lined baking sheet.  Brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. Sprinkle on toppings, as desired. \\n12. Bake the Bagels: Bake for 20-25 minutes. You want the bagels to be a golden brown.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\\n\\n\\n### **Recipe Notes**\\n\\n* Overnight - I put this together before bed and make the bagels in the morning. The fermentation is about 8+ hrs. \\n* Flour - I tend to use bread flour.  Sometimes I substitute in a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of bread flour.\\n* Fermenting -  I tend to ferment in my oven overnight, giving it a strong sourdough flavor.  When proofing it in the morning, I put it into the oven with just the light on.\\n* Put whatever makes you happy in your bagel.  Trader Joes has a great everything mix.\\n* All this can be done by hand… \\n* I also use silicon bagel molds, they keep a great shape and you can drop them right in the water after they have risen ([https://www.amazon.com/Lekue-Bagel-Maker-Individual-Molds/dp/B01LO0KFJK](https://www.amazon.com/Lekue-Bagel-Maker-Individual-Molds/dp/B01LO0KFJK))\" }\n",

If we generate it now, we see this:\\n\\n      diff --git c/gdb/regformats/aarch64.dat w/gdb/regformats/aarch64.dat\\n      index afe1028..0d32183 100644\\n      --- c/gdb/regformats/aarch64.dat\\n      +++ w/gdb/regformats/aarch64.dat\\n      @@ -35,7 +35,7 @@ expedite:x29,sp,pc\\n       64:x30\\n       64:sp\\n       64:pc\\n      -32:cpsr\\n      +64:cpsr\\n       128:v0\\n       128:v1\\n       128:v2\\n\\n    IOW, that commit left regformats/aarch64.dat still considering CPSR as\\n    32-bits.  regformats/aarch64.dat is used by GDBserver for its internal\\n    regcache layout, and for the g/G packet register block.

Because GDB thinks CPSR is\\n    64-bit (because that's what the XML description says), GDB will be\\n    reading the remaining 32-bit bits of CPSR out of v0 (the register\\n    immediately afterwards), and then all the registers that follow CPSR\\n    in the register packet end up wrong in GDB, because they're being read\\n    from the wrong offsets...\\n\\n    gdb/\\n    2014-10-01  Pedro Alves  <palves@redhat.com>\\n\\n        * features/aarch64-core.xml (cpsr): Change back to 32-bit.\\n        * features/aarch64.c: Regenerate.\\n\\n## Bring the system to a halt\\n\\n~~~\\nStarting network...\\nStarting dropbear sshd: OK\\n\\nWelcome to Buildroot\\nbuildroot login: root\\n# echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger\\nsysrq: SysRq : DEBUG\\n\\nEntering kdb (current=0xffffffc87b78c200, pid 769) on processor 1 due to Keyboard Entry\\n[1]kdb> kgdb\\nEntering please attach debugger or use $D#44+ or $3#33\\n~~~\\n\\n~~~\\nwychelm$ aarch64-linux-gnu-gdb vmlinux\\nGNU gdb (Linaro GDB 2015.02-3) 7.8-2014.09-1-git\\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

The already mainlined kgdb NMI infrastructure (mostly \\n   found in drivers/tty/serial/kgdb_nmi.c) will re-route the kgdb \\n   console UART's interrupt signal from IRQ to FIQ. Naturally the UART \\n   will no longer function normally and will instead be managed by kgdb \\n   using the polled I/O functions.

The rebase from v3.18-rc3 to v3.19-rc2 was\\n  trivial (no conflicts at all) so you can probably just stick with what\\n  you already have in kgdb-next.\\n\\nThis patchset implements restricted modes for the KDB debugger. These\\ncan be used to provide some diagnostic capability to a users with access\\nto the debug console without giving unrestricted access to the system. \\n\\nThere are no outstanding review comments for this patchset.\\n\\nMost obvious use cases are to realize a diagnostic mode to tackle\\nin-the-field failures of systems such as mobile phones, web kiosks or\\nembedded devices. A concrete example is the serial debugger found in\\nsome android devices which is typically multiplexed over the headphone\\nor USB socket. Currently Android cannot use kdb for this purpose\\nbecause it introduces risks to user data if the phone were connected to\\n\\\"evil\\\" audio hardware.\\n\\nThe feature is conceptually similarly to the existing code to mask the\\navailable magic SysRq commands. For this reason it is implemented in a\\nsimilar way with modes for disable-all (0), enable-all(1) and a bitmask\\nto enable/disable groups of functionality.\\n\\nThe implementation of the mask check includes a feature to allow a\\ncommand to change which group it belongs to based on whether or not the\\ncommand has arguments (for example, go without arguments is a very safe\\ncommand whilst go with an argument allows arbitrary changes to the\\nprogram counter).\\n\\nThere are a few patches, some are just cleanups, some are churn-ish\\ncleanups, but inevitable. And the rest implements the mode -- after all\\nthe preparations, everything is pretty straightforward. \\n\\nChanges since v4:\\n * Drop patches to avoid deadlock on sysrq spin lock (Rik van Riel's\\n   984d74a72076... is a much better approach).\\n\\nChanges since v3:\\n * Improved commenting on safety of calls to __handle_sysrq_nolock\\n * Remove magic shift value in the command categorization values and\\n   expressed the flags using shifts to make code review of the defined\\n   shift value easier.\\n\\nChanges since v2:\\n * Fixed stupid build error when CONFIG_KDB[_KIOSK]_DEFAULT_ENABLE was not\\n   defined.\\n * Increase flexibility by allowing the userspace greater control over the\\n   commands to be restricted.\\n * Removed the \\\"kiosk\\\" terminology. Its confusing.\\n\\nChanges since v1 (circa 2012):\\n\\n * ef (Display exception frame) is essentially an overly complex peek\\n   and has therefore been marked unsafe\\n * bt (Stack traceback) has been marked safe only with no arguments\\n * sr (Magic SysRq key) honours the sysrq mask when called in kiosk\\n   mode\\n * Fixed over-zealous blocking of macro commands\\n * Symbol lookup is forbidden by kdbgetaddrarg (more robust, better \\n   error reporting to user)\\n * Fix deadlock in sr (Magic SysRq key)\\n * Better help text in kiosk mode\\n * Default (kiosk on/off) can be changed From the config file.\\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc kgdb-bugreport@lists.sourceforge.net \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Ingo Molnar <mingo@redhat.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Colin Cross <ccross@android.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"kernel-team@android.com\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc patches@linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linaro-kernel@lists.linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Sumit Semwal <sumit.semwal@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Anton Vorontsov <anton.vorontsov@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix \\\"RESEND PATCH v5 3.19-rc2\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--signoff --find-renames \\\\\\n\\t--cover-letter \\\\\\n\\t--notes \\\\\\n\\t-8\\n\\nRESEND: <1420648498-17428-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nRESEND: <1415284607-7628-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nRESEND: <1408456922-12221-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv5: <1399381429-16194-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv4: <1399381429-16194-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv3: <1398443370-12668-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv2: <1396453440-16445-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\n\\n= KConfig =\\n\\nconfig versatile_defconfig --kgdb --nfs --modernize --enable PRINTK_TIME\\nconfig multi_v7_defconfig --kgdb --nfs --modernize\\n\\n\\n= Documentation =\\n\\nWhen running a kernel with KDB compiled in,\\n/sys/module/kdb/parameters/kiosk controls the functions allowed to be\\ninvoked on the kdb console.

Wondering there might be patents.\\nYeah..\\ndanielt\\tIf so that's quite easy. We just throw it out.\\n:-)\\npaulliu\\tOK. Anyway, I'll just include that and let you decide.. :)\\ndanielt\\tThat's fine.\\nIt's what BSP analysis is for.\\npaulliu\\tYes. I'll finish that before end of this week. Just in the mid way of splitting. \\nAnd I'll make sure it builds..\\ndanielt\\tIn truth, things with clear answers are great (even if member doesn't like it).\\nThere's no negotiation when things are clear.\\nOne thing that came up last week regarding images for Actions is the reuse of the rootfs image.\\nThe HiKey rootfs image is also being used on DragonBoard.\\nOnce we have S900 it would be good to standardize on that too.\\nDoes that cause you any trouble?\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nNo. Not trouble. \\ndanielt\\tOk.\\nActually I'm interested in how to S500 work has been plugged together.\\npaulliu\\tJust currently there's no way to modify bootargs so we cannot change the rootfs. Actions are modifying that right now.\\ndanielt\\tThere's always a way to change bootargs if you *have* to (you can make kernel ignore bootloader)\\npaulliu\\tWe've test u-boot stuff on S500 right now. And their S900 u-boot have the same issues with S500.\\nThat means, mbrec on GPT table, and other stuff.\\nSo where to get the rootfs image of Hikey?\\nAre we using the linaro-image-tools to do that or we have something new?\\ndanielt\\thttp://builds.96boards.org/\\nYou'd probably be best of using the snapshots...\\ndanielt thinks if we're going to use the same image on all 64-bit boards we shouldn't put it in the HiKey directory.\\ndanielt\\tIIRC alip boots to X by default... if SoC doesn't have fb you probably want the developer image.\\nIs the S500 integration work all ad-hoc? Which Linaro tools were being \\\"shown off\\\" here?\\npaulliu\\tI'm using make-kpkg to generate their kernel packages. With some overlays. And use linaro-hwpack-create to generate a hwpack for them. And use linaro-media-create to generate the final images.\\nThe binary image is generated by live-build. And is a Debian unstable image right now.\\ndanielt\\tMakes sense.\\nSo not CI integrated but easy to do so when the time comes?\\npaulliu\\tYeah. I use make-kpkg because the kernel tree is not ready. When CI is there, we don't use make-kpkg, we maintain everything in tree and CI generated the kernel package.\\nAnd we create hwpack from CI's kernel package.\\ndanielt\\tWe talked about initial flash loader yesterday...\\nIs this \\\"just\\\" a question of \\\"where do resources come from to write it\\\" or is there a technical question about how to do it.\\npaulliu\\tYou mean the eMMC writer?\\ndanielt\\tYes.\\npaulliu\\tOn Monday's discussion, I think we thought it is a technical questions. Because there should be a *standard* way to do that across all the 96boards.\\nBecause there are eMMC on 96boards.\\ndanielt\\t96boards does not standardize on a common way to do initial flash.\\npaulliu\\tAnd if there are several different ways to write the eMMC on 96boards of different vendors, that could be a problem for developers, right?\\ndanielt\\tSort of...\\nMost developers don't care enough about bootloader to want to reinstall it.\\nu-boot can upgrade itself (can't it). So it is only u-boot *developers* (and people who brick their system) that need to use the tool.\\nTaking HiKey as an example...\\npaulliu\\tWell, the SD-card always works.\\ndanielt\\tcircuitco install an image (including fastboot) during manufacturing.\\npaulliu\\tBut I think they are talking about if the developer don't want to use SD-card. And there should be a standard way of writing images to eMMC on 96boards.\\nok. I got your question.\\nSo the problem is init flash.\\ndanielt\\tIt should be the only use case for the low level tools.\\npaulliu\\tBut we haven't talk to that far on Monday's meeting.\\nIf fastboot is already there and nobody will overwrite it, it should be ok.\\ndanielt\\tOnce an adequate bootloader is installed (u-boot, fastboot, uefi+network-applet) then the bootloader is used to provision kernel and rootfs\\nDoesn't have to be fastboot.\\n96boards mandates \\\"an open source bootloader\\\" but doesn't dictate which one.\\nGoing straight to u-boot and documenting how to update kernel and rootfs is sufficient.\\npaulliu\\tok. But the problem is, the user might want to use android, and the other wants Debian. They need to replace the bootloader?\\ndanielt\\tHowever low level tools are needed (generally can't change partition layout without a low level flasher)\\nWe would like advanced users (and developers) to be able to experiment with different partitionings.\\nIn other words we do want low level tools but we don't care about standardizing how they operate.\\nI think this is because many rely on running ROMed code making it impossible to standardize (some use UART, some use USB).\\npaulliu\\tOK. I can understand that. \\ndanielt\\t (and then there's qualcomm who usually like to have a de-brick from SD jumper to avoid sharing lowest level code)\\npaulliu\\tDoes android required fastboot? I think it is, right?\\ndanielt\\tTechnically speaking, no but in practice most android SoC companies use it by choice.\\npaulliu\\tSo if an eMMC preloads u-boot and Debian, and I want to install android on it, I must replace the bootloader, and use vendors tools.\\nBut it is ok, I'll tell them that we don't have any standards for the eMMC.\\ndanielt\\tThat depends on how android is packaged for the board.\\npaulliu\\tI mean, our Android. or AOSP. Because Actions won't give us their android stuff. That's high confidential.\\ndanielt\\tOften the LCR packages are designed to boot without fastboot (it makes it easier to test in LAVA)\\nFor example vexpress-tc2 (which is installed in LAVA with a fairly inflexible UEFI bootloader).\\npaulliu\\tI'm not familiar with android. Can u-boot chainload fastboot when u-boot is running?\\ndanielt\\tI think that uses all the hwpack and linaro-media-create stuff you are used to.\\ndanielt remembers that this is for boot-from-SD using the \\\"magic\\\" SD mux\\npaulliu\\tok..\\nI'll figure that out after finishing the s900 kernel tree. \\ndanielt\\tOk. For LCR we can do pretty much anything that works!\\nMoving onto some process stuff...\\nI need to create some cards for the work you have been doing and will do.\\nI'm thinking:\\n1. S500 build (as discussed about), you'll probably fill in the engineering status and close the card.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\t2. BSP analysis (plus derived blueprints).\\ndanielt thinks the CARD for #2 will be assigned to me but many of the blueprints will be with you. Is that OK?\\ndanielt\\t3. S900 debian build\\npaulliu\\tyes. \\ndanielt\\t4. S900 Android build\\ns/Android/LCR/\\n(end of list)\\nIs there anything else Actions have asked you to look at?\\npaulliu\\tNo right now.\\ndanielt\\tI'm sure there will be more ;-\\n)\\npaulliu\\tYes. there will be more. But the hardware still needs 2 weeks I think.\\nBecause they have some delays.\\ndanielt\\tRegarding LCR do you know any of the Android team from your previous work at Linaro?\\nShame about the delay... it needs two weeks two weeks ago.\\npaulliu\\tNo. I've co-work with them but Freescale doesn't really like to have Android then.\\nSo basically bero made an image for Freescale, but it works pretty bad.\\nSlow and low-resolution.\\ndanielt\\t(because no accelerated GFX?)\\npaulliu\\tYes. And I think Actions also won't give us the GFX stuff for Android.\\ndanielt\\tWe'll see. That is one of the very few aspects of certification that is clearly stated!\\nA 96boards consumer product must have accelerated GFX.\\npaulliu\\tWow, they said they don't want to give that to us because other members will copy things from them.\\ndanielt\\tI thought they ran a MALI.\\npaulliu\\tThey also said that they are the first one who have accelerated GFX, I'm not sure. But if other members have that already, they'll release after them I think.\\ndanielt\\tWHAT?\\npaulliu\\tI didn't say anything because I don't know what's the status of other members. Let's see.\\ndanielt\\tIs it Taiten who should get clarity for this?\\npaulliu\\tI'm wondering Taiten is not there at that meeting, but yes, we should ask Taiten and bring that problem on next Monday.\\ndanielt\\tOk. If nothing else I want a *very* clear explanation of the objection.\\npaulliu\\tNow the regular meeting is on Monday.\\nBut they did ask us to just ran a android without accelerated GFX.\\nThat's what they just want.\\ndanielt remembers Actions S900 is based on PowerVR\\ndanielt\\tIs that right?\\npaulliu\\tYes. \\ndanielt\\tMakes more sense then...\\nThey are going to be one of the first SoC vendors to integrate latest Rouge GFX\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tStill not clear how they manage to add \\\"special\\\" value by integration.\\nAny integration in userspace can be binary only.\\nOnly bits they would have to share would be kernel driver.\\nOk so a summary:\\n1. @danielt needs to make sure Taiten gets a good answer for accelerate GFX.\\n2. 96boards has fairly weak requirements for bootloaders (no further action needed from me).\\n3. @danielt will create cards as agreed above.\\n4. @paulliu will update engineering status\\nYou happy with #2?\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\ndanielt\\tOk.

Examples include:\\n\\nhttps://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=83568 (original memory barrier\\napproach reduces but does not eliminate memory ordering problems)\\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.7/+bug/1706281\\n(assertion failure on weakly ordered systems... as predicted by MariaDB\\ndeveloper)\\n\\nNote also that user reports focus on assertion failures (a.k.a. a\\ndatabase server crash) but given the nature of some of the assertions \\npart of a lock implementation) there may also be scope for undetected\\nrace problems too.\\n\\n`Private note`: In addition to the publicly available information a\\nmember has also reported that they are able to reproduce these problems.\\nMember in question is using a large scale server chip (I think based on\\nA72 cores). However I don't think we have been granted permission to\\ndisclose this. Additionally the scale of system they are using to\\ngenerate the load may make reproducing on small scale systems very\\ndifficult (the Xeon sending the requests to provoke load on the Arm\\nsystem looked to me like a 2,500$ slab of silicon).\\n\\nCI loops to detect SMP race problems can be challenging to setup since\\nprovoking SMP races \\\"in the lab\\\" can prove very difficult and require\\npowerful, complex hardware running at high load (and with an advanced\\nenough micro-architecture to provoke the problematic ordering sequences).\\n\\nHowever ultimately it would be poisonous to the ecosystem for AArch64\\nto be \\\"the architecture were databases are not reliable\\\" hence\\nbring this to the attention of the steering committee.\\n\\nDelivering any resulting fixes upstream has the potential to be\\ndifficult. It is hard to quantify at present (AFAIK nobody invovled\\nthus far within Linaro has any significant MySQL experience). However\\npotential obstacles includes:\\n\\n * the Oracle CLA,\\n * probable concern within Oracle to ensure that no patch originated\\n   from MariaDB,\\n * the importance of avoiding performance regression on x86 (MySQL bills\\n   MySQL 8 as massively faster than MySQL 5.7).\\n * Oracle engineers have already attempted [work of this nature][1] but\\n   it was reverted shortly before the MySQL 8 release. Nothing in\\n   version control indicates why the code was reverted but if it was\\n   performance related it could lead to conservative decision making\\n   by the maintainers.\\n\\nUltimately delivering this work is likely to require a period of trust\\nbuilding with the Oracle engineers and could potentially even involve\\ndemonstrating the credibility of any testing taking place at Linaro.\\n \\nMy tentative opinion is that we should expect to spend a *lot* longer\\nworking on social and testing aspects of the work than on technical\\npatch authorship.\\n\\n`Private note`: Right now I cannot possibly support the conclusion,\\npresented in private discussion, that only two weeks of effort will be\\nrequired. To be clear I do not have the experience to produce an\\naccurate estimate but my own gut reaction is that at least two months\\nof effort are required (probably more) and at least 6 months of elapsed\\ntime.\\n\\nI have not thought about, and make no comment, about the need or\\ncomplexity of backporting upstream fixes (which would target MySQL 9)\\nto either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 8.\\n \\n[1]: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/085c728e33119b3daa2057e66ec8fa14281d4cea#diff-970be570e9f3fd38da39efbd8bdb6ed3\\n\\n\\n\\nBinary images and \\\"the docker problem\\\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nPotentially Linaro could also seek to influence Oracle to ship a wider\\nvariety of AArch64 binaries.\\n\\nCurrently MySQL provide \\\"community\\\" binaries for AArch64 platforms as\\nRPMs (e.g. test packages that work in Oracle Linux). It does not provide\\nofficial binaries nor any binaries for apt based operating systems.\\n\\nCurrently it can be difficult to modify existing x86_86 centric Docker\\nrecipies that rely upon MySQL so that they work on AArch64. This occurs\\nfor images based on Debian/Ubuntu distros that fetch upstream MySQL\\npackages. Such recipes cannot fetch equivalent binary packages for\\nAArch64 and fail to rebuild.\\n\\nThe (recently introduced) MySQL 8 community binaries mean this is less\\nof an issue that it was 12 months ago since right now it only affects\\nrecipies that cannot use the community RPMs.\\n\\n\\nMariaDB\\n-------\\n\\n> MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the\\n> MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free\\n> and open-source software under the GNU GPL. Development is led by\\n> some of the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to\\n> concerns over its acquisition by Oracle Corporation.\\n> -- Wikipedia\\n\\nSince the fork MariaDB has taken a different approach to weakly\\nordered systems compared to MySQL.\\n\\nMariaDB stripped out the adhoc memory barriers replacing them with\\nC++11 atomics and using them to explicitly provides support for\\narchitectures with weakly  ordered memory systems (especially ppc64 and\\nAArch64).\\n\\nNote: Both databases have switch from C++98 to C++11 independently\\nsince they forked but I don't believe MySQL 8 makes much use of C++11\\natomics).\\n\\nIn some markets there may be inertia that forces users to explicitly\\nprovide support for MySQL, however in markets where this inertia is\\nabsent MariaDB can act as a drop in replacement and eliminate concerns\\nabout memory ordering. For example for simple embedded use cases with a\\ndatabase and a web UI adopting MariaDB should be easy.\\n\\nNote: Pre-canned docker images are an interesting case here. In most\\n      cases it should be technically easy to adopt MariaDB but if the\\n      docker image has a conservative maintainer who does not use\\n      AArch64 (or ppc64) they will see no value in changing.\\n\\nThe ability of MariaDB to act as a replacement in many markets means I\\ndoubt there will be much interest in MySQL memory ordering problems in\\nother Linaro groups (e.g. outside of LDCG).

We can thank Spectre and Metldown for that... and lets\\nlook to that in more detail.\\n\\n#### Spectre/meltdown\\n\\nThese were hardware vulnerabilities but *looked* like software\\nvulnerabilies... we have a process for this and it was *not* followed.\\n\\nInstead all the reports went to the hardware vendors (and later to\\nsome distro vendors) who were prohibited from telling \\\"the kernel\\ndevelopers\\\". Resulted in siloing and fragmentation.\\n\\nMeltdown fixes were developed in public with \\\"an unconvincing cover\\nstory\\\" to explain them. Improved even by developers who were not privy\\nto the full disclosure. Arrived on time, at good quality and all distros\\nshiped more or less the same fixes.\\n\\nSpectre family did not have this property. Not ready at the point of\\ndisclosure and early attempts to fix did not survive scruitiny of\\nmainline code review.\\n\\nDevelopers were burned out, frustrated and, even now, not fully\\nrecognised for the huge effort invested here... and others were left out\\nin the cold (Debian in particular was notified very late... and other\\ndistros were never prewarned at all).\\n\\nGood news: lessons have (hopefully) been learned from this. We have\\nreason to hope the normal community processes will be more involved in\\nfuture.\\n\\nBad news: We know everything about the software on the open source world\\nbut it runs on hardware. A big black box that we can only learn about by\\nobservation (what is on the box isn't quite what we thing is on the\\nbox).\\n\\n#### Stable kernels\\n\\nLonger-term support (longer than the 2 year default). Greg will support\\nv4.4 to 2022 and v4.9 to 2023 and the civil infrastructure initiative\\nare looking to find ways to support for even longer.\\n\\nCatching more fixes: 4.9 has 9,976 changes (of 136,000 changes on\\nmainline). Have undoubtedly missed some fixes along the way. Work is\\nongoing to try and identify fixes that haven't been tagged (Sasha\\nLevenson has been using AI to help identify these things).\\n\\nSimple fact: Kernel developers to not run stable kernels (even\\nmaintainers only run tests on them and then go back to mainline) so\\nsubtle regressions might not get caught. Other problems include\\ninvasive changes that are slow or too expensive to backport.\\n\\nIs long term stable concept broken? What stops people using the \\\"best\\\"\\nkernel the community can create.\\n\\nAncient hardware provides a drag.\\n\\n#### BPF\\n\\nMany people have not understood have significant BPF is!\\n\\nA in-kernel virtual machine that is used for a variety of applications.\\nHas a safety verifier combined with a simple in-kernel JIT.\\n\\nCrops up in a variety of places:\\n\\n * Security policy: seccomp, landlock\\n * Protocol implementations: IR remote control\\n * Instrumentation: kernel tracing\\n * Networking: filtering and processing (AF_XDP)\\n   - firewall interfaces are being refactored to generate custom BPF\\n     processing on the fly\\n   - XDP is about bring parts of the kernel back into part of the\\n     network stack that have been pushed into userspace in recent years.\\n     Makes it possible for different parts of userspace networking]\\n     code not to trust each other (and relies on BPF to split flows\\n     efficiently and dispatch to userspaces).\\n\\nPushing code to userspace (beyond scope of BPF):\\n\\n * AF_XDP\\n * ELF modules (userspace code that is part of\\n   the kernel)\\n * userfaultfd\\n * [some others I missed]\\n\\nThis is a huge blurring of the user/kernel boundary. Don't want to call\\nit a \\\"micro kernel\\\" but...\\n\\n#### Code of Conduct\\n\\nLDD3 didn't get a cute animal with huge eyes, the publishes selected\\na wild west theme... perhaps there was a reason for that!\\n\\nThere were lots of things missing in the olde days\\n\\n * Version control\\n * Change tracking\\n * Release discipline\\n * Rules on regressions\\n * CI\\n * ... and no code of conduct\\n\\nAdding a code of conduct is sinply another step along this road to\\nmanage the project better.\\n\\nDon't expect this to kill the fun... and if it is fun then keep doing\\nit.\\n\\n## Buildroot vs Yocto\\n\\nLuca, AIM Sportline (develops dashboards for race cars)\\n\\nShares experience of a buildroot user landing in a company that uses\\nYocto/OE. \\n\\nSimilarities only run as deep the high level mission. Diverge\\nimmediately after that.\\n\\nBuildroot directly generates rootfs (packages copies our directly to\\ndirectory hierarchy, yocto/OE uses packages as an intermediate state\\n(rootfs and update feed can be generated from packages).\\n\\nYocto has layers where buildroot has BR2_EXTERNAL.\\n\\n * Layers are all powerful... and have interesting version skew problems\\n   as a result\\n * For BR2_EXTERNAL we simply get to add packages, not to modify\\n   anything that already exists.\\n * BR2_EXTERNAL gets burned into your .config so a configured tree knows\\n   how to build itself within any environment\\n\\nYocto \\\"classes\\\" is similar to buildroot package infrastructures ($(eval\\n$(autotools-package))\\n\\nBuildroot has fairly weak dependancy analysis to look for changes,\\ngenerally you have to know what packages you have changes and rebuild\\nthem. bitbake does deeper checking (but still has manual overrides for\\nforce a package to build).\\n\\nLearn the yocto directory layout...\\n\\nbuildroot `make graph-depends` allows you to see why some dependencies\\nget pulled into the build.\\n\\nYocto doesn't have similar graphic tool but `bitbake -g -u taskexp\\nworld` it good to showing how *tasks* (not packages) depend on each\\nother. This is finer grain... but very bulky.\\n\\nYocto: Trick to get traditional build log it so pipe the output of\\nbitbake into cat (for super deep logs add `-v`). That way bitbake\\nhas no terminal and it doesn't do any interactive tricks.\\n\\nBuildroot has `make -s printvars` to show internal variables that can be\\nused to debug unexpected build choices.\\n\\nBitbake -e will show the global environment but this is not often\\nuseful because there is extensive per-recipe overrides. Try `bitbake -e\\n<recipe>` instead.\\n\\n##  The Modern Linux Graphics Stack on Embedded Systems\\n\\n*Michael Tretter, Pengutronix*\\n\\nTop-to-bottom but focussing on Wayland/Weston and embedded use-cases.\\n\\nStack:\\n\\n * Client apps: Qt, GTK, Chromium\\n * Wayland Compositor\\n * Mesa, libdrm\\n * Kernel\\n * GPU, Display\\n\\nOpenGL (and Vulkan apps) bypass the compositor for rendering. They\\nrender locally and share the surface with with the compositor.\\n\\nWhat makes embedded special: Limited hardware resources, memory\\nbandwidth and (battery) power. This implies hardware accelerators\\nfor intensive operations.\\n\\nFeatures: GPU, complex display controllers, hardare codecs.\\n\\nFeatures are mix 'n match (single SoC gets these components from\\ndifferent vendors), if you are lucky there can be a common pixel\\nformat (but even if there is one that is cross-compatible it might not\\nbe optimally efficient for all use-cases)\\n\\n### User interface development\\n\\nWe can start development on a powerful workstation (with its stable\\nreliable debugging facilities)... but we need to optimially use the\\nhardware...  \\n\\ndma-buf, atomic mode-setting (allows you to switch between planes to\\nsave power for static images without artefact), accelerators using\\nspecial video formats\\n\\n### Weston\\n\\nWeston is a reference wayland compositor which results in it being\\nhighly feature complete and without imposing much chrome. It therefore\\nsuits a number of embedded uses cases well.\\n\\nExample of feature completeness:\\n\\n - Generic plane assignment layer to exploit the output hardware\\n - Will fallback to rendering itself (using GPU) when planes are\\n   exhausted or offer insufficient features.\\n   + Q: How does format negotiation with application?\\n   + Does not support direct output of tiled buffers\\n \\n### Alternatives to Weston\\n\\nwlroots:\\n\\n * Modular compositor\\n * Implements an unusual protocol: wlr_layer_shell_unstable_v1 protocol\\n   (hints about window placement, etc)\\n   - Used by sway, phosh, rootston\\n * No overlay planes\\n\\nQt Wayland Compositor\\n\\n * Provides QML APIs (super easy for app devs with QML experience to\\n   assemble a custom compositor).\\n * No atomic modesetting, no overlay planes, etc\\n\\n### Open questions\\n\\n * Is the desktop development environment useful for UI developers?\\n * Should the compositor really hide hardware complexity?\\n   - Do apps need to be given more control and information?\\n * How to decide between rendering and using overlay planes?\\n\\n##  Handling When Things Go Wrong: The Right Way\\n\\n*Jono Bacon, Jono Bacon Consulting*\\n\\n### Crisis management\\n\\nBeware the Striesand effect... don't (be seen to) try to hide information\\n\\ngitlab example: Created a Google Doc to allow users to discuss and\\ncontribute to problem solving.

Example, use\\ndownload to fetch a firmware tarball (and unpack), then overlay the\\nunpacked tarball into specific directory, such as `/boot/firmware`.\\n\\nWe can also use overlays to drop files directly into the rootfs\\n(ideally into conf.d directories but can also clobber existing files)\\n\\n### Run actions\\n\\nAllows script to be run either in the fakemachine or on the target.\\nScript has environment variables available to it to help it do its work:\\nROOTDIR, ARTIFACTDIR, ...\\n\\n### image-partition and filesystem-deploy actions\\n\\nCan create fully customized partition tables and then populate the\\nfilesystems within the image.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\nSee debos-recipes\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nRoadmap is \\\"as and when\\\"... nothing defined.

However it has since grown\\nmore powerful because allowing kdb to reuse existing kernel\\ninfrastructure gives us extra opportunities.\\n\\nBased on the comments at the top of irqdesc.h (plotting to take the\\nirq_desc structure private to kernel/irq) and the relative similarity\\nbetween FIQ debugger's irqs command and the contents /proc/interrupts\\nwe start by adding a kdb feature to print seq_files. This forms the \\nfoundation for a new command, interrupts.\\n\\nI have also been able to implement a much more generic command,\\nseq_file, that can display a good number of files from pseudo\\nfilesystems. This command is very powerful although that power does mean\\ncare must be taken to deploy it safely. It is deliberately and by\\ndefault aimed at your foot!\\n\\nNote that the risk associated with the seq_file command is why I\\nimplemented the interrupts command in C (in principle it could have been\\na kdb macro). Doing it in C codifies the need for show_interrupts() to\\ncontinue using spin locks as its locking strategy.\\n\\nTo give an idea of what can be done with this command. The following\\nseq_operations structures worked correctly and report no errors:\\n\\n    cpuinfo_op\\n    extfrag_op\\n    fragmentation_op\\n    gpiolib_seq_ops\\n    int_seq_ops (a.k.a. /proc/interrupts)\\n    pagetypeinfo_op\\n    unusable_op\\n    vmalloc_op\\n    zoneinfo_op\\n\\nThe following display the information correctly but triggered errors\\n(sleeping function called from invalid context) with lock debugging\\nenabled:\\n\\n    consoles_op\\n    crypto_seq_ops\\n    diskstats_op\\n    partitions_op\\n    slabinfo_op\\n    vmstat_op\\n\\nAll tests are run on an ARM multi_v7_defconfig kernel (plus lots of\\ndebug features) and halted using magic SysRq so that kdb has interrupt\\ncontext. Note also that some of the seq_operations structures hook into\\ndriver supplied code that will only be called if that driver is enabled\\nso the test above are useful but cannot be exhaustive.\\n\\nChanges in v3:\\n\\n * Moved comment explaining why seq_file's lock member can be left\\n   uninitialized to the right patch.\\n\\nChanges in v2:\\n\\n * Added nop inline version of kdb_print_seq_file() and used it to fix\\n   build error when CONFIG_KGDB_KDB is not set (oops).\\n * Better comment explaining why seq_file's lock member can be left\\n   uninitialized.\\n \\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc kgdb-bugreport@lists.sourceforge.net \\\\\\n\\t--cc patches@linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linaro-kernel@lists.linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Paul Gortmaker <paul.gortmaker@windriver.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Mike Travis <travis@sgi.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Dimitri Sivanich <sivanich@sgi.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Hedi Berriche <hedi@sgi.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Sumit Semwal <sumit.semwal@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Anton Vorontsov <anton.vorontsov@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Colin Cross <ccross@android.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"kernel-team@android.com\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix \\\"PATCH v3\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cover-letter \\\\\\n\\t--notes \\\\\\n\\t-3\\n\\nv3: <1408459062-19120-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv2: <1398872427-18435-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv1: <1398781841-15152-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\n\" }\n",

Looks good\\n     (and includes a fix to make it possible to correctly read 64-bit\\n     registers).\\n   - Latest firmware images for HiKey (which switch to new MCU\\n     firmware and support more sophisticated power management) prevent\\n     JTAG access once the kernel has booted. Clearly not a blocker for\\n     Bubblegum-96 but will eventually road block further openocd dev.\\n     for armv8.\\n\\n * Hisilicon: upgrade MCU firmware and stub clock driver [Leo, Noone]\\n   (PS-30)\\n   - Stub clock driver have been merged by kernel's clock\\n     maintainer, send patch series v1/v2 for mailbox driver for\\n     review;\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Support cpuidle/hotplug/suspend [Leo] (PS-31)\\n   - Finished suspend flow support for kernel 3.18\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (PS-72)\\n   - Finished generalizing code to choose between NMI and normal IRQ\\n     handling. Removes the last obvious hack from the code case!\\n\\n * Linaro: Prepare EAS/IPA briefing [Leo] (PS-80)\\n   - Prepared and Delivered presentation for Amlogic\\n\\n * Linaro: Deliver Upstreaming 101 and 201 at SFO15 [Daniel] (PS-81)\\n   - Tracked down copies of the slides from HKG15 and watched video of\\n     101 from HKG15.\\n\\n * Qualcomm: WiFi and BT for DragonBoard 410c [Fengwei] (PS-12)\\n   - Created smd tty driver for kernel 4.2 based on old smd tty\\n     driver. Removed lots of stuff from old smd tty driver because\\n     I just want it work with bluetooth instead of general big tty\\n     framework. Blueboot worked OK with this smd tty driver.\\n   - Got feedback from Qcom wifi team: they will not give any help if\\n     we are NOT using prima driver. So we are on our own to figure\\n     this issue out.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Spreadtrum member build for TSharkT ARM64 board\\n   [Fengwei] (PS-63)\\n   - Checked mem-lcr patches couple of times, no other patches\\n     obviously could trigger display issue. Highly suspect it's\\n     related with binary drop from Spreadtrum.          Asked\\n     Spreadtrum engineer again to reproduce this issue     in their\\n     side. But he didn't want to commit...\\n   - Suggested Spreadtrum engineer whehther we could make the\\n     current android64 code as member build regarding the mem-lcr\\n     15.06 is not smooth.

This allows\\n     us to eliminate cache effects from side-by-side benchmarking of\\n     the two interrupt masking mechanisms.\\n   - Ran micro benchmarks on Hisilicon D02 platform. Initial results\\n     look very promising (PMR masking may even have better\\n     performance).\\n   - Adding debug information to try and determine why NMI does not\\n     pre-empt on real silicion (when it does on simulator).

Sent\\n     patch set to Mathieu for private reviewing and sent to the\\n     mailing list for RFT.\\n   - Sent patches to fix unknown_thread NULL pointer issue for\\n     CoreSight auxtrace code, the patches have been merged into\\n     mainline kernel next branch.\\n   - Sent out CoreSight disassembler patch series RFT v2/v3, and\\n     consolidated with ARM's Rob for handling CS_TRACE_ON packet.\\n   - According to Mathieu suggestion, re-spined patches RFT v4 and\\n     sent three rounds to the Coresight mailing list for ARM/Linaro\\n     preview.\\n   - Sent patch series 'perf cs-etm: Fix tracing packet handling and\\n     minor refactoring' to LKML and got the green light from Mathieu.\\n   - Reported by Spreadtrum engineer now the Coresight doesn't support\\n     CPU suspend/resume flow for Coresight 'sysfs' mode; discussed\\n     this with Mathieu and we think this is a valid user case to be\\n     supported and need take it as low priority after Coresight kdump\\n     integration.\\n   - Discussed with Mathieu, it's good to prototype to use OpenCSD lib\\n     with crash extension program for tracing data parsing.  If this\\n     is valid we can directly dump tracing data without generating\\n     synthetic perf format file. Working on this (20%).\\n   - Have finished the Crash extension program to integrate OpenCSD\\n     lib, so now can directly decode Coresight tracing data with Crash\\n     tool.\\n   - Reported by Mathieu the building failure for linking OpenCSD\\n     libs, so tweaked the building progress to firstly install OpenCSD\\n     on system and then link OpenCSD from system lib path.  This can\\n     work both for x86 and ARM buildings.\\n   - Sent patch series 'perf cs-etm: Fix tracing packet handling and\\n     minor refactoring' v2 to LKML to keep it warm.\\n   - Read the TRM for ETM tracing for memory accessing.\\n   - Have some discussion with Mathieu for following up Coresight\\n     kdump patch set, need to following up below items for moving\\n     forward:\\n   - Understand Intel PT + write doc for it;\\n   - Verifiy STM with kdump on one board;\\n   - Enabled kdump on DB410c and Juno r2 with installation Debian\\n     'Brute' root FS; enabled and verified kdump with ETM and STM\\n     trace data on mainline kernel on these two platforms, also\\n     verified crash extension program for decoding ETM and STM trace\\n     data from kernel dump file.\\n   - Enabled Intel PT with kdump on an x86 laptop, also verified crash\\n     extension program ptdump.so can work well on the laptop for\\n     decoding PT trace data.  Studied Intel PT PMU driver and crash\\n     extension code, and finished the doc for Intel PT related\\n     implementation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pc5bsfzUBLbd5\\n     rMx4StxOHcU7fhC2vr2cpE62ZKWYSI/edit?usp=sharing\\n   - Worked out patch series v5 and shared with Mathieu for reviewing.\\n     The patch series v5 supports ETM perf mode, ETM SysFS mode and\\n     STM SysFS mode.\\n   - Heavily refactored crash extension program to support perf ring\\n     buffer and extract metadata from driver data structure and\\n     totally removed metadata dedicated structures.\\n   - Shared STM enabling and snapshot method on CoreSignt ML with\\n     Christophe (ST); shared two captured trace data with Mike for\\n     decoding failure analysis.\\n   - Worked out 3 fixing patches for ETM perf ring buffer and sent to\\n     the CoreSight mailing list for review.\\n   - According to Mathieu suggestion, simplified CoreSight Kdump patch\\n     series v5 by removing support STM/ETM with SysFS mode.\\n   - Refactored crash extension program.\\n   - Though before have enabled mainline kernel on Juno-r2 board, but\\n     Juno-r2 board have two issues with mainline kernel: one issue is\\n     usb stick is unstable and seldomly disconnect from bus; the\\n     second issue is CoreSight components cannot register\\n     successfully;\\n   - Did bisection and narrowed down mailbox patches are missed for\\n     Juno board on mainline kernel; found two reasons for usb stick\\n     instability issue, one is to disable USB bus autosuspend; another\\n     is to USB hub with external power supply.

IOMMU\\n   - The camera_v2 driver directly plays with the iommu via call to\\n     arm_iommu* or msm_iommu*. These functions don't exist with arm-\\n     smmu and arm64. Actually this is abstracted by the dma-mapping\\n     layer which can be backed by iommu or non-iommu devices.\\n     Typically, in the device tree, a device can reference a iommu\\n     phandle. Then iommu is automatically attached to the device and\\n     to the dma ops during DT parsing. The driver does not have to\\n     manage iommu anymore and just has to perform regular dma\\n     operations. This has big impact on the camera v2 architecture\\n     which strongly relies on this manual iommu management (cf\\n     cam_ssmmu_api.c).\\n   - For now I'm not sure if we have to change the whole driver to use\\n     abstracted iommu solution or try to port the old arm_iommu\\n     helpers to minimize camera_v2 changes. Both solutions seem\\n     challenging.\\n   - Patches:\\n   - [media: msm: camera_v2: Fix NULL pointer derefence|https://dev-\\n     private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.git/commit/?h=basler\\n     -4.11-dev&id=a8263d17688ccbf5e06edcfecf22d01497556cbf]\\n   - [media: msm: camera_v2: Change driver name to msm-\\n     cam|https://dev-private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.git/\\n     commit/?h=basler-4.11-dev&id=8e9ed448ad1ab268adc7f4d89a3cfe2170b7\\n     8f70]\\n   - [dtsi: msm8996-camera: Disabel unused/broken nodes|https://dev-\\n     private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.git/commit/?h=basler\\n     -4.11-dev&id=a1a3d09cb2756f2ee599f473121ff3a7653c559b]\\n   - [dtsi: msm8996-camera: Add camera subsystem SMMU\\n     nodes|https://dev-private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.gi\\n     t/commit/?h=basler-4.11-dev&id=929f6c5793d59a3cbde25fbe6ecee45e20\\n     94ec16]\\n   - [arch: arm64: dtsi: msm8996-camera: Add power-\\n     domains|https://dev-private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.\\n     git/commit/?h=basler-4.11-dev&id=42b92a083802ba648d9a336abefdeeb9\\n     76ed5670]\\n   - [media: msm: camera_v2: Do not fail on zero\\n     regulator|https://dev-private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linu\\n     x.git/commit/?h=basler-4.11-dev&id=1b79b013067be322f7772cd45a74ac\\n     01f17e8e13]\\n   - [media: msm: camera_v2: provide dummy bus-scaling op|https://dev-\\n     private-git.linaro.org/linux-baslerweb/linux.git/commit/?h=basler\\n     -4.11-dev&id=e25ce4942c8d6396460cff1657bdc451d38f79af]\\n   - Note: I'm now able to build the driver (in part) and had to fix\\n     some runtime issues.\\n   - I had to disable:\\n   - Bus scaling operations, this is not supported by upstream kernel\\n   - Regulators (in code and DT). downstream driver manipulates\\n     regulator (and clocks), I disabled the associated code and DT\\n     parameters since this would request additional porting.

John Stultz reports there have resetting is caused by thermal on\\n     Android common kernel 4.9 on Hikey, so took time to verify\\n     thermal can work well in ACK 4.9.\\n   - Verified the Linux-next branch is broken on Hikey, and used\\n     bisect to root cause the patch \\\"[PATCH] initramfs: make initramfs\\n     honor CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT\\\" caused the booting failure. Reported\\n     the bug on LKML.\\n   - Have reworked PSCI code for Hikey, the code is used for Hikey\\n     upstreaming and have been merged into ARM-TF mainline code.\\n   - John Stultz reported the GPU benchmark poor performance and I\\n     reproduced this issue;\\n   - After applied GPU devfreq driver with higher OPP still saw the\\n     performance issue: ~1200 scores with kernel normal setting, ~1400\\n     scores with thermal disabling. Have shared testing result with\\n     Hisilicon.\\n   - Per Guodong's request, finished verification work to accelerate\\n     UEFI+ARM-TF adoption in AOSP. Have delivered the testing reports\\n     to LMG and Guodong, so far except LED and a seldom USB panic, the\\n     fundamental functionalities work well with UEFI+ARM-TF.\\n   - Debugged WALT panic cases for Hikey960, there has one erratum\\n     should be applied on CA73 CPUs; and discussed in eas-dev mailing\\n     list there has a missed WALT patch should be applied on kernel;\\n     verified the patch can fix the WALT panic issue.\\n   - Enabled per-CPU buffer for pstore for debugging the CPU lockup\\n     issue; narrowed down the lockup issue is related with CA73's\\n     highest OPP 2.3GHz, and with Daniel suggestion using shell script\\n     can easily reproduce the lockup issue.\\n   - Have enabled watchdog driver on Hikey/Hikey960, and sent related\\n     patches for upstreaming mainline kernel.\\n   - Supported Daniel Lezcano for Hikey thermal driver reworking,\\n     Daniel is starting thermal related work on Hikey and found there\\n     have many places can be improved. So provided some background\\n     info when I wrote the driver.\\n   - Have committed Hikey coresight DT patch and clock fixing patch to\\n     LKML; the coresight clock fixing patch has been ACKed by clock\\n     maintainer.\\n   - Reviewed and tested Daniel Lezcano's 13 patches for Hikey thermal\\n     driver.\\n   - Tested several patches from Kevin to narrow down the hang issue\\n     and finally found the hang issue is related with \\\"on-chip LDO\\\";\\n     after disabled OCLDO the hang issue can totally dismiss. Kevin\\n     will update a new MCU firmware for the fixing.\\n   - Backported patch \\\"arm64: arch_timer: Workaround for Cortex-A73\\n     erratum 858921\\\" for stable kernel, but Marc reviewed the patch\\n     and suggested to port the complete patch series rather than\\n     single patch.\\n   - Pinged Alex to check if Alex can take the backporting task for\\n     erratum 858921; but Alex suggested me to firstly port this series\\n     to stable kernel then he can backport to LSK.\\n   - According to github reporting, found sec_xloader.bin/mcu.img have\\n     hang issue. I tried it with UEFI/ARM-TF and reproduced it as\\n     well. Finally Haojian reverted the latest images in github and\\n     track this issue on 96boards bugzilla.\\n   - Verified latest video blob binaries on latest Android master\\n     branch, so this is consistent with Vishal at his side finding,\\n     the video blob binaries have compatible issue with latest Android\\n     master branch due video blob binaries have used Hisilicon gralloc\\n     lib but master branch uses open sourced gralloc lib.\\n   - Found two regressions on Linux mainline kernel for Hikey; the\\n     first one issue is related with Coresight debugging module cannot\\n     dump for panic, have sent patch and wait for Mark/Mathiue's\\n     comment. The another issue is related with kernel panic after\\n     enable VMAP_STACK option, finally found this is very likely\\n     related with CPU errata, after changed to use latest ARM-TF with\\n     CPU errata fixing, the kernel panic dismisses.\\n   - ARM Robin pinged me the fip.bin for uboot stucks with fastboot\\n     downloading, I can reproduce this issue at my side.\\n   - Root caused Hikey ARM-fastboot stuck issue, it's caused by the\\n     image size for fip.bin including u-boot.bin is not 64 bytes\\n     alignment, so DMA transferring cannot accomplish successfully.\\n     Shared temporary fixing with ARM Robin Randhawa.\\n   - Per Sahaj requirement, added DT binding for thermal multiple\\n     sensors for his experiment for VR HAL enabling in Android.\\n   - Hangouted with Valentin for Hikey960 energy modeling, we finally\\n     agreed to power modeling data based on with fan and fixing DDR to\\n     400MHz. Verified Valentin patch from gerrit and has been merged;\\n     so this is good for later optimization.\\n   - Reviewed and verified Kevin Wang patch for GPU clock fixing for\\n     4.9 kernel.\\n   - Root caused Hikey960 \\\"CPU_NAP\\\" idle state frequently\\n     entering/exiting issue, and sent patches to ARM-TF and LKML\\n     respectively; ARM-TF patch has been approved by ARM maintainer\\n     (in testing process);\\n   - Fixed ramoops bug on Hikey960 android-4.9 kernel: wrongly dt\\n     binding;\\n   - Sent patch for ARM-TF for fiptool.c to pack alignment size so can\\n     avoid usb downloading stuck issue (on Hikey/Hikey960 both needs\\n     to 512B alignment for downloading image size); and shared the\\n     reproduce steps for this issue for ARM maintainer so can help\\n     them to reproduce this issue at their side (Thanks a log for\\n     Haojian for many detailed discussions and Vee for building\\n     fip.bin+uboot scripts preparation for ARM team).\\n   - Investigated the Hikey960 bug: \\\"Kernel crash on idle state exit\\\"\\n     (https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614), verified the\\n     watchdog can work well and reboot system at my side with\\n     Hisilicon legacy booting images and UEFI/ARM-TF. But I cannot\\n     reproduce Valentine reported backtrace issue, by only analysis\\n     Valentine kernel log, it's quite likely the watchdog interrupt\\n     has been configured as FIQ and cannot trigger the system reset.\\n   - Invested time for bug\\n     https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614 for two working\\n     items:\\n   - I can reproduce once with Hisilicon legacy boot images but cannot\\n     reproduce it with UEFI/ARM-TF, confirmed the ARM-TF has set\\n     watchdog interrupt to group 1 as non-secure interrupt. And this\\n     bug doesn't block Valentin's development after disabling watchdog\\n     driver. So would like to take this bug as not urgent;\\n   - This bug is annoying due the kernel reports the panic by FIQ but\\n     kernel has no permission to access GICv2 secure registers so we\\n     cannot get know which interrupt is triggered as secure interrupt\\n     and introduce kernel panic. So enabled ARM-TF exception handling\\n     framework (EHF) with EL3 interrupt handling, so can easily get to\\n     know which interrupt number is culprit. The EHF can be easily\\n     disabled by building configuration if we enable OP-TEE on\\n     Hikey960: https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-\\n     firmware/pull/1209 https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-\\n     firmware/pull/1210\\n   - Per ARM-TF team requirement, verified the patch for padding zero\\n     on the tail of fip;\\n   - Helped Haojian to verify UEFI for supporting compressed kernel\\n     image booting.\\n   - Took time to investigate the GPU performance poor issue on\\n     Android common kernel 4.9; compared ARM GPU driver r7p0 for 4.9\\n     kernel and GPU driver r4p0 for 4.4 kernel, after port 4.4 kernel\\n     into 4.9 kernel code base but GPU performance has no improvement.\\n     Shared all info and trace log file to mailing list hikey-\\n     collaboration@lists.linaro.org.\\n   - Sent power management DT binding patch series to LKML for\\n     Hikey960.\\n   - Verified Hikey960 4G DDR patch and committed the patch to github.\\n   - Engaged the debugging work for Hikey display horizontal offset\\n     issue, assisted Haojian to compare old ARM-TF and new ARM-TF\\n     difference; later wrote a patch to disable MCU, secondary cores\\n     booting, PSCI_CPU_SUSPEND flow in exception entry.\\n     Unfortunately, the work cannot root cause the issue, hope this\\n     can help to narrow down it.\\n   - Supported ARM power team for mainline kernel enabling on\\n     Hikey960; Supported Google/John for 4.14 kernel PM patches\\n     porting and verification; Supported Sumit for Debian/boot images\\n     building; Changed partition table to support Debian/Android in\\n     the meantime\\n   - ARM power team reported CPUFreq driver regression, worked out one\\n     temporary patch for tweaking mailbox driver state machine.  Seems\\n     it's stable now and will check with Hisilicon for reliable\\n     fixing.\\n   - Tested Hikey MMC regression patch from John Stultz.\\n   - Re-spined power management enabling patch series v2, and merged\\n     into ARM-SoC tree.\\n   - Have a meeting with Hisilicon for display offset issue debugging,\\n     Hisilicon engineer gave several debugging registers dumping for\\n     DSI and HDMI clock setting.  Haojian now is working for dumping\\n     related registers.\\n   - Built latest Android image and 4.9 kernel for Hikey620 and\\n     followed Hisilicon suggestion to dump DSI and HDMI clock settings\\n     during initialization phase, also tried ADV7533 self-test mode\\n     with color bar and it didn't have offset issue.\\n   - Consolidated with Haojian's register dumping and shared related\\n     info with Hisilicon but so far didn't get feedback.\\n   - Answered questions from Juri for Hikey960 CPUFreq questions due\\n     Juri found the deadline task missing high percentage issue on\\n     Hikey960.\\n   - Answered questions from Valentin for dhrystone testing result\\n     bounce on Hikey960; shared him  my old testing ipython script.\\n   - Had a conference with Joyce and Hisilicon for thermal issue on\\n     Hikey960.

For FIQ to be useful as an NMI on Cortex A9 the kernel must\\nrun in in trusted world hence by default the GIC allows the CPU to\\nacknowledge group 0 interrupts.\\n\\nTwo workarounds have been proposed, one which retrospectively corrects\\nthe problem if it is observed and one which uses the ARM MMU section\\nflags to ensure the GIC driver can read INTACK from the current security\\ncontext. The later workaround, which is both more invasive and higher\\nperformance[1], is presented in this patchset.\\n\\nThis patchset depends upon my own patchset for ARM providing additional\\nFIQ infrastructure but does contain the changes to the GIC driver\\nrequired to support FIQ.

Sadly kgdb does not have any\\npermissions framework so kgdb is just disabled (rather brutally) if\\nthe kernel is locked down.\\n\\nDuring review we have certainly got ideas for further work to finesse\\nthings but nothing we have planned would argue against applying the\\npatch that we currently have!\\n\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nDaniel.\\n\\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc security@kernel.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Stephen Brennan <stephen.s.brennan@oracle.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Konrad Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix=\\\"PATCH\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--base=auto \\\\\\n\\t--signoff --find-renames -1\\n\\n\\nv1: <not-yet-released>\\n\\nTODO:\\n - Scripts to update the --to and --cc using get_maintainer.pl\\n - Change --base=auto to use tags\\n\" }\n",

The kernel can then service the interrupt and call into the firmware to re-enable the interrupt.\\n\\nSome finer details include:\\n\\n1. We have to we have to convert local_fiq_disable/local_fiq_enable into calls to the firmware (both because the F bit cannot be modified in non-secure state and because we need to do an \\\"is-anything-pending\\\" check in software during the enable).\\n\\n2. Apart from the changes in #1 the other calls to the firmware can probably be buried in a custom irqchip driver (i.e. just register a fiq_chip).\\n\\n3. arch/arm64 has no FIQ support at all.

No comments yet.\\n   - Re-based existing arm64 proof-of-concept implementation to\\n     simulate NMI, which uses GICv3+ CPU interface to re-implement\\n     irqflags.h, to v4.2-rc1 mainline. Previous versions of the patch\\n     were based on Linaro integration branches. Also discovered that\\n     FVP support has regressed on Linaro integration branches (since\\n     mid-June) and is no functional.\\n   - Extended above patches to use alternatives runtime support to\\n     dynamically patch irqflags.h. This makes it possible for the same\\n     kernel to run on GICv2 and GICv3 systems.\\n   - Fixed EL1/EL0 IRQ handling to handle NMIs more carefully (i.e.\\n     avoid risk of deadlocks in the generic IRQ handling code).\\n   - Tested on FVP (Foundation Model) to check the NMI still worked\\n     and on HiKey to check for non-regression on GICv2 systems.\\n\\n * Misc\\n   - FVP familiarization. Derive instructions for booting mainline\\n     kernel on FVP (chief trick is to disable CONFIG_PCI).\\n   - HiKey familiarization. Install A-T-F/UEFI, booting mainline kernel\\n     and the hikey-mainline-rebase branch.

And when the kernel updates, there's a script will be run and copy the kernel to the FAT partition.\\nSo bootloaders can see them.\\ndanielt\\tI suppose that makes is possible to avoid the FAT long filename patents... but it would be nicer to mount the FAT partition as /boot directly.\\npaulliu\\tI mean, when user goes into Debian, users can only see vmlinuz-(Version)-arm64 and initrd.img-(Version)-arm64\\nAnd the script will convert vmlinuz to Image and initrd.img to uInitrd on the FAT partition.\\ndanielt\\tPossibly tweaking fstab to mount the FAT partition as /boot/u-boot would be a worthwhile user convenience.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tScript is still needed to update kernel but as least it is transparent to user what is happening (does current script mount/unmount)\\npaulliu\\tBut if we want to make fastboot work, we have to create the boot.img first. Is there any documentation about this?\\ndanielt\\tI'm afraid I would have to send you to Fathi...\\npaulliu\\tBut currently I think fastboot cannot flash any images because there's no partition tables on eMMC.\\ndanielt\\tIts the sort of thing the linaro-media-create scripts do (and internally they tend to work with loopback mounts)\\npaulliu\\tOK. I'll ask Fathi.\\ndanielt\\t... but fastboot can flash a partition table first.\\nThat's what is does on Hikey\\npaulliu\\tIf flash a partition table, the u-boot gone.\\nNow u-boot is on the partition table.\\nSo if you remember the crazy partition patch, that's for this.\\nWe have to write the partition to dtb.\\ndanielt\\tWhat?\\npaulliu\\tAnd userspace will read a fake partition from dtb.\\ndanielt\\tDoes u-boot read it from dtb too?\\npaulliu\\tU-boot can read kernel from other places.\\nI didn't see u-boot has that mbr{} block inside its dtb.\\nBut kernel does.\\nAnd inside mbr{} block, pentry describe the partition entry.\\nIf you look into the owl_mbr_init() that's for setting up the partition table.\\nSo currently we have to use SDCard.\\nput the kernel/initrd to SDcard, instead of eMMC.\\nthe u-boot is on eMMC's partition table place right now.\\nThis will be fix after August.\\ndanielt\\tHiKey doesn't have this insanity so I talked about eMMC but for Bubblegum-96 we can replicate this on SD can't we?\\nPut another way why can't fastboot write partition table to SD card?\\npaulliu\\tI'll try if fastboot writes to SDCard. But seems to me it writes to eMMC right now.\\ndanielt\\tIt probably does but that's arguably a misconfiguration if things like fatload point at SD card.\\nIf SD card works from fastboot it ought to be a fairly small change to point fastboot at it (though its several weeks since I read the u-boot implmenetation of fastboot)\\npaulliu\\tok..\\ndanielt is having a quick look at the code\\ndanielt\\tSo... there is CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV which allows you to choose which MMC device you write to.\\nIts not clear whether SD card uses mmc driver or has a special one.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\nShould be mmc driver. mmc dev 0 inits the sdcard in u-boot\\ndanielt\\tWhat value does CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV currently have for the actions port?\\npaulliu\\tBTW, how to use fastboot to write partition tables.\\ndanielt\\tFor real fastboot is \\\"just works\\\" (there is a magic partition called ptable).\\npaulliu\\tI didn't see any CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV inside the configs/atm9009_evb.h\\ndanielt\\tHave a look at fb_mmc_flash_write() (in common/fb_mmc.c). Maybe your version is older and hard coded?\\npaulliu\\tit has \\\"dev_desc = get_dev(\\\"mmc\\\", CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV);\\\" insode that function.\\ndanielt\\tThat's same as mine... I wonder where it comes from...\\npaulliu\\t#ifdef CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV\\n#include <fb_mmc.h>\\n#include <owl_atc260x.h>\\n#endif\\ndanielt\\t(as in if/how it gets defined)\\npaulliu\\tok.. I'll figure that out with Action guys.\\ndanielt\\tSo I've just been having a look around... there are some not-yet-upstreamed patches to get u-boot fastboot to change partition table.\\npaulliu\\tBecause they did define CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH, but not MMC_DEV\\ndanielt\\tHmnnn... if that happens then, with upstream sources, fastboot cannot write to flash! It unconditionally reports fail.\\npaulliu\\tyes, it reports fail right now.\\ndanielt\\t(it would also do that if there is no partiton table)\\nPerhaps add a printf to prove which code paths are taken...\\nSome next steps you could try without actions are to pre-partition SD card on PC and see if CONFIG_FASTBOOT_FLASH_MMC_DEV is enough to make things work. \\nIf there anything else from your side this week?\\npaulliu\\tno.. not from my side\\ndanielt\\tOnly thing from me is to say neither Scott nor I have heard anything about boards.\\nOnce they are booting we would like boards too (can you mention this at next weekly meeting with Actions)\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tThanks.\\npaulliu\\tWhat do you mean \\\"booting\\\". minSDK is booting already.\\nJust go into initramfs.\\ndanielt\\tYes. I should really have said \\\"now they are booting\\\" :-)\\ninitramfs is fine... enough for buildroot!\\npaulliu\\tyes.\\nSo we just ask them to send some boards to you and Scott next week?\\ndanielt\\tYes please.\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\ndanielt\\tSo I think that's it.\\nGood luck!\\npaulliu\\tok.. thanks a lot.\\n\\n # scottb\\n\\nWork for the team... things are very quiet at the moment.

Each one gets us closer to where we want to be.\\nKeep an \\\"original\\\" branch arround so we can check we make no mistakes in rebase, amend using git diff original\\nDaniel Thompson\\n5 mins\\nYing-Chun Liu\\nSo do you have a suggested sequence for the patches? Like we should add \\\"arch\\\" code first? or drivers first. \\nYing-Chun • 5 mins\\nTypically one has a basic platform. The minimum needed to boot platform, normally arch/  and uart driver, maybe also clock and reset drivers if needed.\\nAfter that drivers can be ordered much more freely.\\nDaniel Thompson\\n3 mins\\nYing-Chun Liu\\nOK. Got it.\\nYing-Chun • 2 mins\\nIn the ideal case the patches end up decoupled.

      "NoteBody { id: \"a9f81bf836114ce5b64683ef7d7e92ca\", body: \" # Audio driver for MediaTek SoC Audio\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\nMT6735 is the device for which upstream drivers are being prepared. The \\npremium services engineering team has not been explicitly a part number\\nbut MT6735 appears in the driver comments and is used extensively in the\\nrest of this document.\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n * mt_soc_audio_v3 contains little or no code suitable for upstreaming.\\n \\n * A driver for MTK AFE is already included in the mainline kernel and\\n   forms a better basis to upstream MT6735 audio support.\\n \\n * The premium service engineering team will provide mentoring services,\\n   including detailed pre-LKML review, to help build MTK developers\\n   confidence.\\n\\n * Linaro is willing to provide additional \\\"hands on\\\" work to support\\n   development of DMA or codec drivers.\\n   \\n\\n## Suitability for upstreaming\\n\\nIt is hard to find any code in the current mt_soc_audio_v3 driver that\\ncould be upstreamed without rewriting from scratch. The three most\\nsignificant problems are:\\n\\n 1. Duplicated code\\n 2. Harmful abstraction layers\\n 3. Disregard for Linux coding style\\n\\nNote: Based on previous Linaro experience, it is actually very likely\\n      MediaTek engineers are already aware of some or all of these\\n      issues. The remainder of this section merely reinforces the above\\n      and can be skipped by readers who agree with the summary.\\n\\nThe kernel provides, in a single source base, drivers for many thousands\\nof devices. To make this task manageable, upstream maintainers will not\\naccept duplicated code. The current driver code makes extensive use of\\ncode duplication to handle parametrization or minor differences between\\ncomponents. De-duplication will potentially be very challenging because\\nit looks like the duplicated code has diverged over time. When combining\\nthe code it is hard to distinguish bug fixes from \\\"random\\\" divergence.\\nThe files that match mt_soc_pcm_dl*.c are especially strong examples of\\nthis.\\n\\nThe AudDrv abstraction layer actively encourages the duplication\\nidentified in the prior paragraph and would need to be replaced to\\npermit de-duplication.  AudDrv_Clk.[ch] is a particularly extreme\\nexample. This code was probably originally written to link the\\nparameterized clock framework to the existing, and heavily duplicated,\\ncode. Today its purpose it to make setting up the clocks *more* complex\\nand calling directly into the clock framework. Note also that similar\\nproblems would emerge if AudDrv_Afe.[ch] were ported to the new(ish)\\nregmap API.\\n\\nMinor coding style issues can be overcome, especially in fully debugged\\nand well structured code where the value in retaining the code is clear.\\nHowever, given the other problems in the code base, it is unlikely to be\\nworth the effort of overcoming coding style issues. To illustrate the\\nmagnitude of the problem consider that checkpatch.pl, whose checks\\nwill not reveal all problems, reports >4000 errors and warnings (one\\nissue for every nine lines of source code).\\n\\nEven disregarding other issues, like the already existing mainline driver,\\nthe problems outlined above already indicate that a new driver must be\\nwritten from scratch.\\n\\n\\n## Existing mainline driver\\n\\nThe mainline kernel already contains a driver for the\\n[mediatek,mt8173-afe-pcm]() (mtk-afe-pcm.c). Comparing the register maps and\\nvalues between the two drivers show that both MT8173 and the MT6735\\nimplement the same, or very similar, AFE. With the MT8173 driver already\\naccepted upstream the only way to add audio driver support for MT6735 is\\nto extend the existing driver.\\n\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n 1. Use pinmux (see pinctrl-mt65xx.txt) to manage all static (soldered\\n    down on the board) pin routings.\\n\\n 2. Adopt the mtk-afe-pcm.c driver and use it as a basis for any usecases\\n    common to both MT8173 and MT6735.\\n\\n 3. New codec and amplifier glue (necessary to hear results from #1\\n    and #2). The MT8173 upstreaming effort suggests that MT8173 is\\n    typically paired up with PC-like codecs and it is not clear what \\n    the audio feature set of their MT6397 PMIC is.  This makes it \\n    unclear whether codec/PMIC related code for MT6397 needs to be new \\n    drivers or extensions of existing ones.\\n\\n 4. Extend mtk-afe-pcm.c to support any additional use cases once the\\n    existing support is fully exploited.\\n\\nNote: Based on calls found in the mt_soc_audio_v3 derive we have assumed\\n      that other work is already being undertaken to provide upstream clock\\n      and pinctrl drivers.\\n\\n \\n## Help from Linaro\\n\\nAs part of the normal premium services offering Linaro is able to:\\n\\n 1. Provide additional on-site training, including the new Advanced\\n    Upstreaming course.\\n\\n 2. Provide (remote) mentoring including pre-LKML review of patches\\n    for developers new to upstreaming and feedback on how to improve\\n    ML interactions.\\n\\nIn addition to the Premium Services Engineering is willing to provide\\n\\\"hands-on\\\" engineering assistance to assist with #3 to shorten the\\ntimescale to show functional drivers based on the recommendations above.\\nWe would expect MediaTek engineers, also be working on the above\\nrecommendations, to \\\"buddy up\\\" with PSE engineers. This is to ensure all \\ndevelopers move in a coordinated manner and to ensure that Linaro \\ndevelopers are not impeeded by lack of access to documentation and \\nother corperate knowledge.\\n\\n\" }\n",

Will refine patch\\n     according the comments.\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (KWG-56, PS-72)\\n   - Russell King posted an alternative NMI printk patch. Reviewed and\\n     posted comments (there is a bug in the arm implementation).\\n   - Received feedback from Will Deacon regarding changes I proposed\\n     to the alternative (dynamic patching) code. He liked my approach\\n     but asked for it to be wrapped up differently. Worked to meet\\n     Will's request.\\n\\n * Qualcomm: WiFi and BT for DragonBoard 410c [Fengwei] (PS-12)\\n   - Got the response from Srini that second approach used to\\n     defer firmware loading is good. Waiting for merging (by Nico\\n     who is taking leave).\\n   - Andy shared the pil-wip branch and could start to upgrade the\\n     wifi driver based on it. The code was downloaded.\\n\\n * Spreadtrum: Spreadtrum member build for TSharkT ARM64 board\\n   [Fengwei, Jam] (PS-63)\\n   - Little progress on this. The main reason is connection to linaro\\n     private git was closed by server very frequently. Checking with\\n     ITS on it.\\n   - Asked Spreadtrum to review the local manifest from mem-lcr 15.06.\\n     So we could discuss which components from mem-lcr should be\\n     included in android64 member build.

That was, overall,\\na benefit. There even had a degree of training-the-trainers so focussing\\non the *right* conversations is more important than covering the\\nmaterial for the sake of it.\\n\\nSome of the material could have been presented better (some of the live \\ndemos on day 2 ran too long without opportunities for consolidation in \\npractical sessions).\\n\\nNevertheless I think if there *had* been a strong focus on slick pacing \\nfor trainees the event itself might have been compromised. Focusing on \\nteaching rather than talking doesn't promote co-operation which is what I think we were aiming at.\\n\\n## Key messages\\n\\n1. ARM PM team consider EAS to be ready for evaluation only. It is \\n   not viewed by its authors as product ready. ARM (draft) roadmaps for\\n   PM software don't, strictly speaking, contradict this. However,\\n   without patient audience to define terminology, the roadmap does\\n   appear to!\\n\\n2. All ARM EAS branches will be rebased regularly (a decision that flows\\n   from #1 above). We may have to help some members develop working\\n   practices to help them consume EAS.\\n\\n3. EAS is viewed as at *feature* parity with the older HMP b.L scheduler\\n   extensions. No claim was made regarding *performance* parity[1].\\n\\n4. ARM PM team are aware we could be a big help for them in scaling\\n   quickly do demand from partners and anxious to help us to that.\\n   They are aware that, whatever they thing, EAS *will* be deployed in \\n   products.\\n\\n5. ARM PEG team are interest in potential for co-operation with Linaro\\n   but are also very aware that Linaro Professional Services may become\\n   a direct competitor to their support/training services.\\n\\n6. ARM's EAS backports to LSK include not-upstreamable patches intended\\n   to boost performance for some workloads. Typically these patches\\n   will be myopically focused to certain consumer-centric workloads\\n   without considering potential for regression.\\n\\n7. ftrace is critically important to diagnosing undesirable behaviour\\n   within ARM scheduler. LSK backports include a number of patches to\\n   provide tracepoints, lisa provides a toolset to closely examine\\n   trace files.\\n\\n8. RFCv6 will primarily be characterised as less likely to regress\\n   SMP workloads (especially multiple homogenous clusters). Since\\n   EAS is already at feature parity main goal now is to eliminate\\n   regressions.\\n\\n[1] I'm afraid I didn't describe this as lucidly in my detailed notes\\n    so I didn't ask too many difficult questions here. However ARM are\\n    not ready to share detailed performance benchmarks... most people \\n    are drawing a conclusion based on that!\\n\\n## Technical coverage\\n\\nAll sessions contained significant Q&A. Much of the value of the trip\\nstemed from the Q&A rather than the agenda below.\\n\\n * Detailed description of EAS goals and implementation.\\n   - Key conceptual area is the \\\"tipping point\\\".\\n   - EAS results in a model scheduler\\n   - Once the \\\"tipping point\\\" is reached energy awareness\\n     is disabled and all tasks are scheduled by the existing CFS code\\n     + CFS is big.LITTLE aware but only for load balancing\\n     + CFS does not seek to conserve energy\\n \\n * Schedtune\\n   - Boosting framework\\n   - Important to understand what is means to boost workloads that are\\n     rate limited by external factors (such as frame rates)\\n   - Boost seeks to reduce time-to-completion\\n     + IIRC boost did not influence EAS when tipped over into CFS mode\\n       time-to-completion)\\n \\n * Code lineage\\n   - tip:sched/core: Contains only EAS core (and it dependencies).\\n   - [linux-3.18-eas-5.2-plus][1]: Official EAS backport branch (the\\n     \\\"performance focus\\\")\\n   - [lsk-v4.4-eas-v5.2][2]: EAS for v4.4. This is a derivation of the\\n     performance focus branch to allow partner evaluation (and our own\\n     v4.1 backport).\\n\\n * LISA\\n   - \\\"Distribution\\\" of useful tools and test code\\n   - Primarily glued together using jupyter/ipython but the library code\\n     can also be used from \\\"raw\\\" test scripts.\\n   - Killer feature is interactive analysis (can cheaply hack together\\n     and trace/monitor complex scenarios)\\n   - devlib: Underpinning to access and control tragets (backends\\n     include SSH and ADB). This is shared with workload-automation\\n   - trappy: Translates ftrace output into DataFrames format allowing\\n     it to be easily (and performantly) consumed by python programs.\\n   - bart: Behavioural assertions and regression testing. Allows\\n     assertions to be made about trace observations (e.g. task starts\\n     running on little core, task transitons from little.BIG after\\n     between N..M seconds if intensive use).\\n\\n\\n[1]: https://git.linaro.org/arm/eas/kernel.git/shortlog/refs/heads/linux-3.18-eas-5.2-plus\\n[2]: https://git.linaro.org/arm/eas/kernel.git/shortlog/refs/heads/lsk-v4.4-eas-v5.2\\n\\n\\n\" }\n",

The patchset also includes an implementation of \\narch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() for arm64 allowing the new code to be\\nexercised.\\n\\nThe code works-for-me (tm) and is getting more \\\"real\\\" each time I\\nrelease it. However there remain a couple of limitations and caveats:\\n\\n 1. Marc Zyngier requested that I split the patchset into two, one to\\n    implement interrupt masking using the PMR and the other to introduce\\n    NMI-like features. I *will* do this, but I decided to put one last\\n    RFC together first! In this release I have re-ordered the patches so\\n    the patches are PMR masking first, additional pseudo-NMI patches\\n    second.\\n\\n 2. FVP needs a bit of hacking to be able to run <SysRq-L> from an ISR.\\n    That's a shame because <SysRq-L> is a great way to observe an NMI\\n    preempting an IRQ handler. Testers are welcome to ping me offline\\n    and I will share the hacks I have been using to test with.\\n\\n 3. Requires GICv3+ hardware to be effective meaning it has mostly been\\n    tested using FVP. The alternatives runtime patching system is \\n    employed so systems with earlier GIC architectures are still \\n    bootable but will not benefit from NMI simulation.\\n  \\nv4:\\n * [X] Rebase on v4.9-rc4\\n * [X] Improved the patch description and commenting of the G bit (Marc\\n   Zygnier)\\n * [X] Improve the documentation for USE_ICC_SYSREGS_FOR_IRQFLAGS (Marc\\n   Zyngier)\\n * [ ] Migrate the application of the PMR interrupt lock outside of\\n       kernel_entry (Marc Zyngier)\\n   + \\\"My own take is that we'd be better off leaving the I bit alone \\n     until we reach the point where we've accessed the IAR register (\\n     hence making the interrupt active and this particular priority \\n     unable to fire:\\n\\n        irqstat = read_iar();\\n        clear_i_bit();\\n\\n     At that stage, the only interrupt that can fire is an NMI (or \\n     nothing at all if we're already handling one).

Can start.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tSo two things on my side.\\n1. S900 BSP review\\n2. Minutes from earlier this week\\npaulliu\\tSo, I finally got a s900. But not getting any SDK right now.\\ndanielt\\tHow many?\\npaulliu\\tTheir u-boot is still not ready. Occupying the GPT tables.\\nOnly one.\\ndanielt\\tI was thinking to perhaps push for two (allows you to develop on one and soak test another)\\npaulliu\\tI think we can get more next week.\\ndanielt\\tTaitain askes what we need.\\nI was thinking 2x for you, 1x for me, 2x for LAVA.\\nWill that be hard to get?\\npaulliu\\tI'm not sure. I was believe that 1 for me, 1 for you and 1 for Lava.\\ndanielt\\tThat was the original proposal in the minutes.\\npaulliu\\tBut the Lava one might want to use a newer board? Because the current geometry problem makes it hard to connect JTAG board.\\ndanielt\\tI was just wondering if that was a \\\"default\\\" or if there is a heavy restriction on board availability (i.e. short run of the initial broken batch).\\nLAVA doesn't usually use JTAG.\\npaulliu\\tGot it. But yes, we can ask more. But I think 1 for me is ok. What do you mean soak test?\\ndanielt\\tRun long test suites...\\npaulliu\\tok. got it. Then yes. I'll need 2.\\ndanielt\\tSometimes its good to be able to develop at the same time these suites are running.\\nYou don't have to do that but its a good option to have.\\nGiven you are doing integration level work soak tests are (I think) an important part of that.\\npaulliu\\tI think they only have 30 right now. And most of them are still in China.\\ndanielt\\tWhat is the timescale for the second batch?\\nPerhaps we keep numbers low for first batch...\\npaulliu\\tWe can ask. They didn't say that but they said they are working on a second batch right now.\\nYesterday they mentioned the second batch but there's no any date.\\ndanielt\\tOk. I will discuss a little bit with Scott. LAVA lab really doesn't like one board (because boards break)\\npaulliu\\tSo currently they are upgrading the s500 SDK for Ubuntu/Debian, and they got some problems on the GFX driver, I'm looking into that right now. \\ndanielt\\tHowever it we are promised one prototype now to be replace with 3x production boards later that might be ok.\\nOne small thing...\\n96Boards devices are not permitted to draw power from USB OTG port.\\nWhen you get your S900 booted please could you plug in USB OTG and then remove and replace the 12v power. I'd like to confirm that this reboots the board!\\n(since they got geometery wrong I'd like to check they didn't miss other certification requirements)\\nLikewise checking board boots automatically when 12v is applied would be good.\\nAbove two tests are a check for \\\"easy\\\" LAVA integration.\\npaulliu\\tGot it. So what I should see is when I remove the 12v power, it shuts down?\\ndanielt\\tYes.\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\nI'll check.\\ndanielt\\tHowever most 96boards only have software controlled LEDs so can't see if board draws power from USB OTG without running software.\\nSo tests are:\\n1. Remove 12v kills system\\npaulliu\\tI know. They have a android install in the eMMC right now.\\ndanielt\\t2. Replace 12v causes system to reboot without any other buttons being pressed.\\npaulliu\\tSo I should be able to see Android on HDMI.\\ndanielt\\tOk. That's great (please Android quiesce a bit before removing power... we need the system to be idling when power is removed)\\nquiesce just means \\\"ready steady state\\\"\\ns/ready/reach/\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\ndanielt\\tMoving on... and also from minutes.\\nTaiten mentions fastboot *and* TFTP.\\nMy advice was fastboot *or* TFTP.\\nI don't mind if actions do both but want to check if that is their choice or not.\\nDo you remember?\\n(background is I was asked what minimum LAVA requirements were)\\npaulliu\\tI think they'll do both. Fastboot and tftp. But they just have more problems to solve first. Like the u-boot and mbrec still occupies the GPT table.\\ndanielt\\tBut they are doing that because they *want* to?\\npaulliu\\tBut fastboot should be good enough for Lava.\\ndanielt\\tYes. Providing they know that I am happy.\\npaulliu\\tYes, they already know that.\\ndanielt\\tGreat! Thanks.\\nShall we talk about BSP review now>?\\npaulliu\\tYou mean the kernel?\\ndanielt\\tYes.\\npaulliu\\tI've branched action3 on Monday and just reading the log.\\ndanielt\\tMy idea is to put review comments into the git checking comments and then write a script to suck out everything and put it into a report.\\n(with links back to patches)\\npaulliu\\tok. I can do that..\\nOr maybe we can just share the branch to Action?\\ndanielt\\tInteresting idea.\\nThat might be enough and saves us time.\\nFeel free to check that with them.\\npaulliu\\tI've chatted with them yesterday about your review. But yesterday we are more focus on the bootloader and boards. Not the kernel because it doesn't load right without bootloader.\\ndanielt\\t(could you also let them know that a westerner writes many review comments... I don't really understand culture well enough to be deferent so I didn't try...)\\npaulliu\\tYeah, I said there are many \\\"comments\\\", not \\\"flaws\\\" or \\\"bugs\\\".\\ndanielt\\tTwo patches concern me in particular...\\npaulliu\\tBut they are *too busy* on the bootloader stuff. All the engineering team are working on bootloader right now.\\ndanielt\\tUntil the bootloader works I think that is OK!\\npaulliu\\tYeah. Yesterday they said their *official* release will be on July. \\ndanielt\\tThat's very amibitious.\\nDo remember that software has to work but upstreaming is not required.\\nHowever if Actions do a certain amount of upstreaming I think Linaro agree to take over certain kernel maintainance roles.\\npaulliu\\tYeah I know.\\ndanielt\\tThat can happen after release however.\\npaulliu\\tWe (Taiten and I) just said that we'd happy to get temporary release.\\nRelease often..Release early stuff.\\ndanielt\\tThere *may* be some rules about kernel version by July.\\npaulliu\\tSo we sort out some important things for bootloader, the first important thing is to not occupy the GPT tables.\\nAnd we don't need the u-boot to be put on SD-card, Just let us to LOAD kernel from SD-card.\\ndanielt\\tYes. The \\\"weirder\\\" the partion tables that harder to use D-I.\\n(D-I might still need some customization if platform loads firmware from special partitions)\\nDo they plan to ship board with SD card?\\n(or is this just for development)\\npaulliu\\tFor early development. Because on eMMC, the u-boot is there so GPT-table corrupted.\\nIf we want to load filesystems, we can only put that to SD-card now.\\ndanielt\\tI see. Makes sense.\\npaulliu\\tSo that's why we ask them to let us to fatload something from SD card first. We don't care u-boot on eMMC.\\nAt early stage.\\ndanielt\\tOk. To be honest the biggest issues for me with kernel review is the crazy partition stuff.\\npaulliu\\tYeah, in order to read filesystems on corrupted GPT table, they need the crazy partition stuff.\\ndanielt\\tDo they plan to remove it from kernel eventually?\\npaulliu\\tBut when they fixed the u-boot, we can remove it.\\ndanielt\\tOk.\\nFor mmc: SDIO for Actions GL520x plus misc MMC hacks\\\" I was planning to say \\\"We will not review this code in current form.\\\"\\nIts just too crazy to review.\\npaulliu\\tOK.\\ndanielt\\tOther code I consider too crazy to review is \\\"soc: owl: Cross-ported (arm -> arm64) driver support for OWL family\\\"#\\npaulliu\\twhy it is crazy? \\ndanielt\\tI plan to get script to find any use of the headers associated with this code and complain!\\nIt is platform code for a kernel (ARMv8) explicitly designed not to need platform code.\\nThis type of code is being carefully cut out of arch/arm and is forbidden in arch/arm64.\\nCopying code to drivers/soc doesn't make it acceptable.\\npaulliu\\tSo you mean for arch/arm64 we don't need platform code?\\nI'm not very familiar with this. But ... really?\\ndanielt\\tThe fragmented code from arch/arm tends to have mutated into proper driver frameworks or been removed.\\nThis is what makes the code in drivers/soc so hard for me to review... it doesn't fit into the driver frameworks.\\npaulliu\\tSo, I'll need to ask what does this driver do, right? \\nto Action.\\ndanielt\\tSort of.\\nIts not really driver code. More its library code to fish out details from the platform.\\nI think ARMv8 guys would simple say \\\"thats a job for system firmware not kernel\\\"\\npaulliu\\tIf the code is a driver, we can drive it by devicetree. For arm64 I really need some time to get used of it. I remember in arch/arm there are still small platform code.\\nShouldn't that be done by devicetree?\\ndanielt\\tMostly yes.\\npaulliu\\tGot it. I'll ask.\\nSo my Actions now are, testing the USB OTG, ask Actions about the newer batch date, and ask the crazy driver/soc. For crazy partition it can be removed. No need to ask.\\ndanielt\\tNote that Actions kernel is, in some places, very good. Mostly of the code written in 2014 could probaby be ported to mainline kernel and sent upstream without too much embarrassment.\\nThere are issues but they are small and not \\\"crazy\\\".\\npaulliu\\tYeah, just let the upstream to review for several rounds.\\ndanielt\\tIf is Actions first attempt to upstream we can probably do some pre-review work (we won't catch everything maintainer will but we will allow maintainers to focus on sub-system related comments not just \\\"general linux\\\"\\nIt means actions would get better quality review comments when they go to mailing list.\\nThe other issue that will be hard to review is the video/gfx drivers.\\npaulliu\\tyes, it is the first attempt for them.\\nvideo/gfx driver is just a small piece of code. I think we normally package them as dkms?\\ndanielt\\tThey actually seem to be quite well positioned to share basic enablement patches (e.g. boot to UART support).\\nNote sure I understand...\\nIn kernel there is a lot of code managing the video output hardware.\\npaulliu\\tSo how about other SoCs? \\ndanielt\\tWe've got out of sequence... what command is \\\"So how about other SoCs?\\\" linked to?\\ns/command/comment/\\npaulliu\\tI mean the video/gfx driver.\\ndanielt\\tThey have quite a bit of code to setup HDMI etc in the driver/video side.\\nThey also have ADF driver to hook it together (ADF being android specific)\\nWe can review this but it is a lot of work. I think it might have to be out of scope for initial review.\\npaulliu\\tOK. got it.\\nYeah, let's focus on boot to UART first.\\ndanielt\\tWhat I'd like to do is start with 3.10. Rip out as many of the patches as we can without regressing boot to UART...\\n... then port what remains to latest kernel.\\nNot sure how that gets resoured though.\\npaulliu\\tGot it. I can do that.\\ndanielt\\tSo for now I will just write about it in kernel analysis.\\nThe tricky bit is deciding how long to spend trying to fix something that should regress UART but does.\\nI would expect some of the PM patches to do that.\\npaulliu\\tPM means power management?\\ndanielt\\tIt would be great if you can work on this. Make sure to bring it up at next meeting with Actions.\\nPM: Yes.\\npaulliu\\tWhy? The power should be initialized by u-boot?\\ndanielt\\tWhat u-boot does, at very high level, it get CPU, RAM and UART running...\\n... then jump to kernel.\\nThat means kernel does not PM support to work because bootloader already did enough pokes and clock setup for UART to work.\\ns/PM/PM and clock/\\nHowever when a kernel has PM and clock for some time, the UART driver may depend on them rather than accept what bootloader gives it.\\npaulliu\\tAh.. got it.\\ndanielt\\tSometimes its worth including clock support in initial bring up patches, other times not.\\npaulliu\\tYes... got it.\\nI just remembered.\\ndanielt\\tGiven clock supoort is a \\\"2014\\\" driver probably we should keep it.\\nIf we can get away with disabling the \\\"2012\\\" PMIC code that would be helpful!\\nWhat have you remembers?\\ns/s/ed/\\npaulliu\\tThe freescale one. The UART is initialized by u-boot at beginning. But the clock driver is needed for other stuff. And it resets the UART clock.\\ndanielt\\tSounds right. Without clock framework UART driver cannot usually generate right baud rates.\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\t... but it can choose not to touch them.\\nAre you OK for me to keep rebasing the action3 branch for now. I'm still making further comments.\\npaulliu\\tSure.\\ndanielt\\tLet me know when you want to start working too and we'll try to figure out a way to co-exist.\\nGit is good for colaboration but git rebase is not.\\npaulliu\\tI'm ok.

Looks at kernel.org!\\n\\n## Slide 6\\n\\nThis is just an illustration. Upstreaming puts you in good company\\nalthough, by and large, we won’t talk about business reasons to upstream\\nin this session.\\n\\n## Slide 7\\n\\nLinus kernel is at the top of the tree\\n\\nOther git trees exist for different reasons, usually topic branches:\\nusb, i2c\\n\\nSome maintainers have a whole bunch of trees for different topics.\\n\\nSome maintainers work together in a single tree.\\n\\n## Slide 8\\n\\nWithin driver subsystems there are often “large” drivers, such as dwc3,\\nwhich have their own maintainer. These are especially common for\\nfrequently reused cells that just need a little bit of per-SoC glue\\nlogic.\\n\\narm is an interesting architecture in that responsibility is fairly\\nstrongly divided in a similar way to the subsystem/driver tree where\\nRussell King is the arm maintainer but the selection of SoCs is so large\\nthere are other maintainers that tend to merge ARM SoC support.\\n\\n## Slide 9\\n\\nMaintainers are not all the same. Find out how the maintainers you will\\nbe working with like to work.\\n\\nA lot of the rest of this session is about how to work effectively with\\nthe maintainers. They control acceptance of incoming patches and you\\nhave to make them happy about your patch.\\n\\n## Slide 10\\n\\nGives a really strong illustration about the size of the hierarchy.\\n\\nGo through what the MAINTAINERS format is (and note that MAINTAINERS describes the format up front).\\n\\n## Slide 11\\n\\nrc7 or rc9 sometimes happens\\n2 week window is pretty fixed\\n\\n## Slide 12\\n\\nThe merge window is when Linus merges code from maintainers. The\\nmaintainers need get their trees ready before the merge window opens.\\n\\nPatches with new features posted in the last couple of weeks before the\\nmerge window opens will have to wait until the *next* merge window.\\n\\nComplex patches need even more time for the maintainer to be\\ncomfortable.\\n\\nBug fixes are always welcome. Changelog comments should make clear that\\nthe change is a bug fix.\\n\\n## Slide 13\\n\\n## Slide 14\\n\\nKnow what you are trying to add\\nKnow what other people are trying to add\\n\\nContributions by proxy can be a challenging. If you didn’t write the\\ncode and haven’t studied it properly, or worse, if you need to consult\\nsomeone else to change the code.\\n \\n * It has your name on it\\n * If a maintainer asks you a question about the code you need to answer\\n   it or it won’t be going in\\n \\n## Slide 15\\n\\nDevice tree is especially important for ARM driver writing. It is\\nimportant to be familiar with it because all bindings must be documented\\nand the documentation accepted by the device tree maintainers.\\n\\n## Slide 16\\n\\nSubscribe to the appropriate mailing lists as soon as you know which\\ntopics you will be working on. Don't be afraid of the delete key.  In\\nfact heavy filtering to discard \\\"uninteresting\\\" topics is much better\\nthan moving everything into a subfolder that you never read. If you get\\nit right you'll see a manageable number of messages that help you better\\nunderstand the philosophy of the sub-system you will be working with.\\n\\n## Slide 17\\n\\nAs I've said before maintainers are not all the same. However Greg KH's\\nposts on how to piss off a kernel subsystem maintainer provide a list of\\nthings that are likely to annoy most of them. Its a great introduction\\nto help you understand how maintainers tend to think.\\n\\n## Slide 18\\n\\ngit is not really optional. My personal mantra for kernel development is\\n\\\"automate everything\\\". Its a great way to avoid mistakes. Git provides\\nyou with lots of automation that helps you do that.\\n\\nIf you are changing something not mentioned in the changelog then your\\ncommit is probably not small enough.\\n\\nAnother important thing is to remember you deliverable is not a C\\nfile... you are delivering a patch. Its important that the patch makes\\nsense, on its own. Making your patch as readable as possible for\\nreviewers is the best thing you can do to promote your work with\\nmaintainers.\\n\\n## Slide 19\\n\\nThe subject line is crucial. It is perhaps the only thing lots of people\\nwill read. I've just told you to unafraid of the delete key and to\\nheavily filter your mail. Just remember that everyone else is *also*\\nunafraid of the delete key and filtering their mail to select only what\\ninterests them.\\n\\nPoorly selected subject lines result in fewer eyeballs. Maintainers\\noften rely on other peoples eyeballs to provide initial feedback for\\npatches.\\n\\n## Slide 20\\n\\nSo... you've got a good subject line. The next thing people will read is\\nthe commit log message. Their finger is still hovering over the delete\\nbutton.\\n\\n## Slide 22\\n\\nGetting To: and Cc: are the final places you can miss out on reviews. Many\\nkernel developers highlight mail when they are in To: or Cc: to make it\\njump out more.\\n\\nJust a word of caution on that subject. Getting To:/Cc: right is\\nimportant but don't add unrelated people to To:/Cc: just to get\\nattention. \\n\\n## Slide 23\\n\\n\\n## Slide 24\\n\\nTo send patches you will normally use git send-email but you still need\\na sane mailer to reply to comments. Also you may want to copy in a\\ndiff fragment as part of a reply and having a sane mailer makes a big\\ndifference here.\\n\\nRead disputes/mini-flames. They are a great learning opportunity.\\n\\n## Slide 25\\n\\n## Slide 26\\n\\nIt you're a SOC vendor its still *your* SOC. For the first year or two\\nof its live you care about it the most!\\n\\n\" }\n",

Bring up LTP-DDT within Debian environment. Fix any problems due to\\n   the change of distro and get suite passing again. Generalize and\\n   upstream any fixes proposed.\\n\\n3.

Bring up #3 on HiKey and Dragonboard using any suitable distro\\n   (compact distros are preferred to minimise test execution time)\\n\\n5. Integrate LTP-DDT to CI loops for BeagleBone Black, HiKey and\\n   Dragonboard.\\n\\nRisks:\\n\\n * Test disablement in step #1 may result in no tests of value\\n   remaining.

Sorry to be late!\\npaulliu\\thi.. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nYeah.. I'm also very busy. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nSorry. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nNot pinged you. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nSo, I'm working on installing the minSDK to 96boards now. It contains U-boot with tftp, and kernel. Should be ok for Lava. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nBut got stucked because it needs Windows tools. I'm asking Linux tools right now. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\nUsing virtualbox with Windows and it is not able to burn the image to eMMC. \\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t    \\t\\t  \\t   \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\ndanielt\\tThat would be good. Its needed to board auto-recovery isn'it it?\\n(from LAVA)\\npaulliu\\tNot sure. Currently we have to install u-boot to eMMC. The SDCard version is still not ready.\\ndanielt\\tShame... SDCard can be handled in LAVA using adapter board.\\npaulliu\\tNot for U-boot right now. So we'll have to install u-boot to eMMC, and currrently need Actions' firmware writer.\\ndanielt\\tI see.\\npaulliu\\tI've got Windows version previously. Just tried. Can't work through virtualbox.\\nI've pass the USB device to virtualbox already and saws the device in Windows. But it always fail at 3% -> 10%.. Because it tries to reset the board once or twice.\\nAnd virtualbox loses tracks of the USB devices I think.\\ndanielt\\tMakes sense.\\nIs there protocol docs? Have Actions agreed to write the tool for Linux?\\npaulliu\\tThey have a tool for Linux I've heard. So I'm asking. The protocol is definitely not open. \\nActually, for s900 image, it still has a lot of protections. For example, when building images through their tools, we have to install wine.\\nBecause we need wine to run Maker.exe to sign the firmware to write.\\nUnder Linux.\\ndanielt\\tThat will be interesting...\\npaulliu\\tI know. But the protection will be removed someday I think.\\ndanielt\\tIt certainly should be... its pointless to share tools containing signing keys.\\npaulliu\\tWe just want to have a minSDK installed and can be test by Lava team.\\ndanielt\\tThey won't like that... (u-boot can probably be used to kill itself and brick the board).\\nI thought the LAVA team like to have automated de-bricking for boards in the lab.\\npaulliu\\thmm.. that need to be discussed later.\\ndanielt\\tOk.\\nI see from the minutes Actions want to know what they need to do to 3.10 kernel to ship it...\\npaulliu\\tI don't know that. I was thinking that we just need to deploy our image to somewhere and run and get some outputs for lava.\\nYeah. They want to host their kernel on our public git tree.\\ndanielt\\tIsn't our public git tree based on 3.18\\npaulliu\\tI'm not sure. On our public git tree there's also 3.10.\\nLSK.\\nThey just want to know \\\"what they need to fix\\\" to allow us to put their kernel on our public tree.\\ndanielt\\tOn the *96Boards* git tree?\\npaulliu\\tOh, we have 96boards git tree?\\ndanielt\\tYes.\\npaulliu\\tI thought it's git.linaro.org.\\ndanielt\\t(although right now its just the hikey git tree)\\nhttps://github.com/96boards/linux/branches/active\\npaulliu\\tSo our standard is 3.18 for 96boards?\\ndanielt\\tThe requirements documents are tentative (and not properly published) but...\\n... the last draft I read wanted either:\\n1. Upstream\\n2. One of the last two stable kernels.\\n(right now that is 3.14 and 3.18)\\nIf memory serves then next week it will be 3.18 and 4.1.\\npaulliu\\tOK...\\nI'll discuss with Taiten.\\ndanielt\\tThe discussion Taiten requested regarding statement-of-work was to get some of the senior guys (of both companies) talking about this.\\npaulliu\\tIf so, we might want to take the responsibility of rebasing?\\ndanielt\\tJust to give you a flavour of what's likely to be covered:\\npaulliu\\tI mean, porting.\\ndanielt\\t    Linux based unbricking tool\\n    Open source bootloader with fastboot support.  Code upstream or integrated into 96Boards trees on GitHub\\n    Open source Linux kernel with full source available.  Code upstream or integrated into 96Boards tree on GitHub.\\n    AOSP based image to be flashed into eMMC on production boards.\\n    Getting Started Guide available.\\n    Hardware documentation - SoC TRM\\n    Board User Guide\\n    Schematics\\n(above is the list of requirements for one of the other 96Boards vendors)\\npaulliu\\tOK.\\ndanielt\\t(statement of work is agreement about how the two companies acheive it)\\npaulliu\\tOK. Got it.\\ndanielt\\tWho does it comes, in the end, down to $$$.\\nActions Semi are not a premium member but they do pay for your time.\\nThis means discussions to refine statement-of-work may be more difficult here.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tBTW in the list above there is a mention of AOSP... that is not a requirement... other vendor *wants* AOSP.\\nFor actions this would be debian based image.\\npaulliu\\tYeah.\\ndanielt\\tAnyhow it sounds like Actions would like to see the BSP assessment pretty soon?\\npaulliu\\tYes. They did. So currently they want to know how if the kernel can be integrated into 96boards tree. And also they want to know if their current minSDK(u-boot) can be used by Lava team.\\nAnd I'm trying the minSDK right now.\\nJust make sure that it can be \\\"installed\\\". And then Taiten will find a Lava person to see what's next.\\nFor kernel, I've send the action3 branches to them.\\nAnd mentioned the partition patch, video patch, and driver/soc patch needs to be discussed first.\\ndanielt\\tOk.\\nI'm still improving actions3 (made fairly good progress this week)\\npaulliu\\tBut haven't get any feedback yet.\\ndanielt\\tShould have completed the [todo] items by end of week.\\n(I'll also try to write a covering letter)\\nIncludes things like recommendations on what to do next)\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tAlso, if it comes up at meetings...\\nBSP analysis is *technical* recommendations on right thing to do.\\nIt is *not* 96Boards requirements.\\npaulliu\\tGot it.\\ndanielt\\tNegotations about that (and who does what) are statement-of-work discussions.\\nPS I'll (re)raise with Scott the publishing of the more details s/ware requirements for 96Boards.\\npaulliu\\tAnd for 96boards, we have different branch for different venders, right. We're not going to use one branch for all right?\\ndanielt\\tIt's a pain not having a doucment to point you (and Actions) at.\\nThe hope was to bring it all together.\\nbut the *plan* to do so was vague.\\nRight now I think HiKey is based on 3.18 and Dragonboard on 4.0 (and currently porting to 4.1)\\nIt is also not clear what level of review the 96Boards github tree is subject to.\\nPart of its role is to be quicker and more agile than upstream... that more or less guarantees a lower quality threshold.\\npaulliu\\tok.. understand. At least, it runs and have to be passed on Lava and CI. \\ndanielt\\tYes (I have added you to Taiten's LAVA thread... Esla and Tyler are making tehcnical replies I think you should see).\\npaulliu\\tok.. thanks.\\ndanielt\\tSo...\\nSummary.\\nI need to: complete BSP analysis, continue raising urgent need to SoC meeting within Linaro.\\nYou are working on mini BSP for LAVA enablement.\\n \\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\tIs there anything else?\\npaulliu\\tNo.\\ndanielt\\t(what are you expecting to be doing after miniBSP?\\nHow long do you think it will take?\\n(if >2 weeks you can forget first question)\\npaulliu\\tJust 1 to 2 days from now. I'll get the Linux burner very fast.\\nAnd I'll look the s500 GFX driver again. They have another problem. Xorg seems not automatically starting they are reported.\\nSo I'll take a look.\\ndanielt\\tOk.\\npaulliu\\tBut it is not related to s900 right now. The GFX driver is actually not the same.\\nBut I'll get a look. \\ndanielt\\tI think next week we must take another look at the cards. I think some of the S900 work is outside scope of current cards (which makes its harder to report your work).\\nNot for this week though.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tOk. So unless there's anything else... I'll see you next week.\\npaulliu\\tyeah.. \\nI'll directly talked to lava guys after the minSDK stuff.\\ndanielt\\tThat would be great. Thanks.\\n\\n # scottb\\n\\n## Actions/96Boards\\n\\nActions need better understanding of Linaro requirements.\\nSpecs would be really useful here.\\nApproaching \\\"crunch time\\\"\\n\\nI am prioritizing the BSP analysis.\\n\\n## MediaTek\\n\\nDeferred\\n\\n## ZTE\\n\\nSuccess!

As a \\nresult of this fact-based decision making EAS presents very few \\ntuneables and thus requires a significantly different approach to \\ntuning and optimization when compared to the tradtional\\ntune/benchmark/repeat cycle. Tuning EAS has perhaps more similar to \\ndebugging: using trace tools such as ftrace, kernelshark and LISA, we \\ncan examine its decision making and look for ways to improve this \\ndecision making. This talk will offer a practical introduction to \\nusing these trace tools.\\n\\nType of Session: Tutorial (has potential to be repeated in Mandarin)\\n\\n## ARM patches\\n\\nARM will release EAS patches to us \\\"soon\\\". Hopefully there will be a\\nwindow where we can see the patches but HiSi cannot (this will take\\npressure of us to rush).\\n\\nARM PM are happy to have a call with us after we have seen the patches.\\n\\nCan we integrate both into the v4.1 and v4.4 code bases? Yes. Good for\\nrelationship with ARM, also gain access to ARM help in testing if we \\nhave v4.4 version.\\n\\nAside: ARM have started hosting their website on Juno's\\n\\nAlex S. will likely allow us to test on his Juno (provide notice whilst\\ndoing early bring up on Hikey).\\n\\nNot 100% clear when ARM will release patches to Linaro. Hopefully at\\nend-of-July and under NDA until mid-August (which gives time to\\npre-integrate before HiSi get the patches). The there is no NDA period\\nwe cannot do the v4.4 port until after we have given v4.1 patches to\\nHiSilicon.\\n\\n## Travel to LAS16\\n\\nLeo has received the flight booking confirmation from the flight desk.\\n\\n## HiSilicon EAS escalation\\n\\nAttended on-site on Friday. Was able to get power down to the \\\"right\\\"\\nlevel (at least according to ftrace) but at a cost to benchmark performance\\n(Geekbench 3: 6300 -> 6200).\\n\\nWill be interesting to see how the ARM patches make Android more aware\\nof EAS...\\n\\nNo feedback from ARM about Leo's optimization patches (neither Chris nor\\nMorten). Will wait until we've seen ARM patches before querying about\\nthis.\\n\\n## Member meeting\\n\\nQualcomm have accepted that EAS is the right direction for power-aware\\nscheduling. Support it clearly at the member meetings.\\n\\nQualcomm have also accepted ARM trusted firmware, to the extent they are\\ninterested in training on it.\\n\\nZTE are very happy with the support from the \\\"local team\\\" who have been\\nhelping them (LT and Premium Services).\\n\\n## Spreadtrum\\n\\nSpreadtrum are running on v3.18 so try to rely on ARM efforts as much as\\npossible.\\n\\nRegarding extra patches on LKML not yet introduced on v3.18 then ping\\nChris Redpath.\\n\\nFor our patches would also be good to ping Chris and let him know we\\nwill share them. Mention that Spreadtrum show signs that they are\\ninvesting in learning about EAS so quite sophisticated understanding\\nw.r.t. EAS and will likely be able to recognise good/bad points of \\nthese patches.\\n\\nIf we share ARM slides with Spreadtrum it must be very clear that ARM\\nare responsible for integrating the patches into EAS for v3.18 LSK.\\n\" }\n",

Have sent out patches to mailing\\n     list for review.\\n   - Gathered trace data files for task's load and utilization data,\\n     cpu's load and utilization data for all rt-app cases; With these\\n     trace data files, analysed corresponding task and CPU's\\n     utilization and load to different workload, and compared them\\n     with Hikey's power modeling parameters for CPU's capacity.

Nico will keep asking more\\n     information from  Qualcomm.\\n   - Setup http server in my another Linux box and tried wget to\\n     download big file through http protocol.

The downloading is stable and the throughput is about\\n     6Mbytes/sec.\\n   - After talked with Qualcomm wifi guy, we were informed that the\\n     wifi throughput issue may be related with BT functionality\\n     because upstream driver doesn't support coexist with BT.\\n   - Confirmed it in my side. My wifi downloading throughput is about\\n     6Mbytes/sec with BT activity. Once I manually start BT scan\\n     operation, the wifi throughput drop to about 1Mbytes/sec.\\n   - There is a little difference: In my side, if there is no BT\\n     action manually triggered (even the BT function is on by default\\n     in GUI), no wifi throughput issue.

It's hard to clearly highlight team achievements \\nwhen mine is the first weekly report issued!\\n\\nComplete plan to promote LSSE among the members. Some ideas are becoming\\nclear but are not expressed clearly anywhere.\\n\\nAdopt LCR for X20 instead of the MediaTek Android release (after\\nconfirming value of this with ARM). This allows us to run benchmarks\\non an up-to-date version of Android that supports the new power HAL \\nfeatures.\\n\\n## Challenges\\n\\nLeo's X20 development board died. Replacement already organised but\\nprobably have to add code to the EAS development codebase to make\\nthermal trip outs less likely.\\n\\n# Personal activity\\n\\n## Progress\\n\\n * Community: Enable GPS on IFC6540 using Linaro [Daniel] (LDTS-1913)\\n * Community: Tool chain for ARMv7-A based on GCC 5.4 [Daniel]\\n   (LDTS-1909)\\n   - LDTS-1909 was a problem locating and downloading the latest\\n     toolchain due to Linaro's stale web presence (esp. the wiki)\\n   - Used opportunity to fix the most misleading part of the wiki\\n  \\n * TI: Toolchain downloads \\\"latest\\\" [Daniel] (LDTS-1918)\\n   - Another consequence of poor external web presence. In this case\\n     symptom is fixed but still need to tackle underlying cause.\\n \\n * TI: kexec & kvm on 32 bit ARM kernels [Daniel] (LDTS-1916)\\n   - A kernel feature request. Outside natural scope of LDTS but a\\n     potential opportunity for solutions engineering.\\n   - Lots of discussion and thoughts about how to handle this\\n\\n * Variscite: MSM8916: Unexpected changes of state on GPIO96 [Daniel]\\n   (LDTS-1915)\\n   - Question from Qualcomm STP.\\n   - Impossible for Linaro to fix it (originates in closed source \\n     Qualcomm code) but we were able to *explain* it so requetor can\\n     make a clear request of Qualcomm.\\n   - Turned round very quickly to minimise delay for user in switching\\n     to Qualcomm support.\\n\\n * 96Boards forum activity\\n   - Automatic GPIO signal detection to make it use as Interrupt based\\n   - Could not enter u-boot shell\\n   - No kernel debug output via serial ttyUSB0\\n   - RILD service not running (2 posts)\\n   - Serial Console on UART\\n   - Unable to enable SPI\\n   - xorg configure\\n \\n  * \\n## Plans\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Pure-NEON (no crypto) ARMv8 implementation of SHA-256\\n   secure hashes [Daniel, Victor] (PSE-88)\\n\\n * LMG-Kernel: Android FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel]\\n   (LMG-302)\\n\\n * Linaro: FIQ debugger upstreaming to mainline [Daniel] (PSE-7)\\n\\n * TI: ARMv8 webinar based training programme [Daniel] (PSE-93)\\n\" }\n",

ADF and has the potential to\\n  simplify KWG-630 (or even, if we are very lucky, render it moot).\\n  \\n* \\\"Vibrant\\\" discusion regarding how to track meta-data for compressed\\n  buffers for different GPU implementations. Potential solution proposed\\n  but no participant (currently) motivated to put effort in that\\n  direction. Will study Nexus-next hardware to see what solution it\\n  selected by Android devs (reasonable grounds to suspect it will may be\\n  a hack).\\n\\n* Shared near term Linaro plans w.r.t. ADF with some of the upstream DRM\\n  developers. No objections but also no new ideas to explore.\\n\\n=== Summary ===\\n\\nXDC is a relatively small conference of ~80 participants, the program\\nwas organised into tracks but the tracks ran sequentially (so no\\nconcurrenct sessions). The largest delegations came from Nouveau\\n(reverse engineering team for nVidia graphics) and Intel. Smaller\\ndelegations from AMD and nVidia. \\n\\nThere is relatively sparse representation from embedded world. Most of\\nthe challenges from embedded world were well understood, the desktop\\nfocus tends to be especially apparent in discussions on constraint aware\\nmemory allocation. ?Potential opportunity for XDC2015?.\\n\\n=== Plans ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sessions attended ===\\n\\n    [My notes regarding the talks are shown in square brackets. Slides\\n    and videos are available for all sessions, see\\n    http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2014/Program/ .]\\n\\nInput:\\n  Where does accessibility plug into the graphical desktop stack?\\n  Consolidating the input stacks with libinput\\n  Adding tablet devices support to the Wayland protocol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nTesting:\\n  Teaching Waffle how to wiggle\\n  Randomized Testing\\n  \\n    [Describes randomized test generation to identify ABI no conformance\\n    problems in shader compilers. Also shows how randomization is used\\n    to *simplify* test cases when bugs are identified.]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nKernel:\\n  Nouveau: Expose NVIDIA's performance counters to the userspace for \\n    nv50/tesla\\n  REclock: Extending Nouveau with Voltage and Frequency Scaling for \\n    NVA3/5/8\\n  AMD's New Unified Open Source Driver\\n  \\n    [AMD will produce *three* driver stacks all sharing a common\\n    foundation within the kernel. Userspace will allow choice of three\\n    drivers: all open, non-pro and pro. All open and non-pro offer the\\n    same nominal feature set but at different levels of maturity\\n    (in *very* long term the non-pro may be dropped). Pro stack is a\\n    superset adding FirePro support (and will requires extensions to the\\n    common base).]\\n\\n  Backlight kernel ABI discussion\\n  \\n    [An amazingly contentious discussion for a ABI composed of a single\\n    integer.]\\n\\n  DRM: Explicit synchronization\\n  \\n    [See highlights. Not only is it great to see nVidia interested in\\n    this area but is also a good starting point for anyone who needs to\\n    better understand *why* explicit sync makes some GFX operations go\\n    faster.]\\n\\nX.Org:\\n  State of the X.Org Foundation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nDisplay servers:\\n  Graphics beyond the main compositor\\n  Wayland fullscreen shell and some ideas about compositor nesting\\n  \\n    [Describes a means by which screen sharing (or just direct remote\\n    display) can be implemented within wayland based operating systems.\\n    Could in principle be used for miracast.

Mature\\n    enough that writing a bespoke DDX driver for modern embedded\\n    hardware is probably wasted effort. Might also be interesting to\\n    use to benchmark the impact of removing GFX blitters from SoC\\n    design.]\\n\\nHPC:\\n  HPC: An OpenCL simulation of molecular dynamics on heterogeneous\\n    architectures\\n  StarPU: seamless computations among CPUs and GPUs\\n  Modern and Interactive Scientific Visualization\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nWindow Systems:\\n  KWin went XCB\\n  Security in Wayland-based desktop environments\\n  Tizen, a Wayland-powered operating system\\n  \\n    [Primary focus of the talk was IVI (i.e. no mention of phones or\\n    TVs). Wayland is a work in progress but is, eventually, expected\\n    to be the primary window system for Tizen.]\\n\\nBSD:\\n  The status of the graphics stack on FreeBSD\\n  Porting drm/kms drivers to DragonFlyBSD\\n  Status of the OpenBSD graphics stack\\n  \\n    [Take home from all three talks is basically the various BSDs has\\n    been historically very fragmented but most have almost got the DRM\\n    drivers from Linux 3.8 to work but, when complete, is in much\\n    better shape to backport the more recent features.]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nEGL & OpenGL:\\n  Status Report on A New Linux OpenGL ABI\\n  Enabling Alternative Window Systems with non-Mesa Graphics Drivers\\n  GLSL compiler: Where we've been and where we're going\\n  NIR, or moving beyond GLSL IR in Mesa\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n= Day 1: Session summaries =\\n\\n== Accessibility ==\\n\\na11y - usable by people with specific needs\\n  \\n * blind\\n * low vision\\n * deaf\\n * colour blind\\n * one hand\\n * cognition (e.g. dyslexia)\\n * motor disability (e.g. parkinson)\\n * elderly\\n\\nwhy?\\n\\ncustom applications end up being tailored to specific needs and lack the\\nmanpower to keep up with features. much better to customize existing\\napplications.\\n\\ncurrent linux status is not so good. gnome is probably best but suffered\\nserious regressions due to the gnome3 rewrite. behind versus windows,\\n\\\"stone age\\\" versus apple.\\n\\nStory of an 'a':\\n\\n- keycode from driver to x which manipulates it but what remains is\\n  a scan code (third row, position 1)\\n\\n- scan code is converted to 'a' in the client (lookup keycode)\\n\\n- converted to pixmap in the client\\n\\n- rendered to server\\n\\nThe concept of 'a' only really exists within the toolkit/client.\\n\\nKeyboard mirroring:\\n  Pass on Kieran's keyboard hack.\\n  Implement in XKB\\n\\nBraile:\\n  Serious problems with layout and standardization of braile.\\n  Multiple key presses\\n  Scancodes won't match that of a normal keyboard\\n  Makes extensive use of context sensitive abbreviations to\\n    boost reading speeds.\\n\\nImpact of wayland on usability:\\n  Much is hung upon xkb, xtest, etc.\\n  Can we intercept keycodes, keysyms and translated.\\n\\nComplex UI would like the application to describe the semantics of its\\ninterface to allows things like text-to-speech or to permit hybrid\\nscreen reader for low vision users. Custom virtual keyboards presenting\\noptions are possible.\\n  Columns mess up the semantics (prevent horizontal flow of information)\\n\\nHow to not mess up:\\n  Difficult because a screen reader often requires training to use.\\n  Can you use the application without the mouse? In particular getting\\n    tab order correct is a big deal.\\n  Orca screen reader has a braile monitor which allows us to observe\\n    what the application is sending to a device.\\n\\n== Input in wayland ==\\n\\nKernel now abstract hardware more or less completely. There are\\ndifferent drivers for different class (mouse, touchpad, wacom) but all\\ngo to the kernel input stack under the covers.\\n\\nX.org: different drivers are fragmented in terms of features.\\nsynaptis and wacom have HUGE overlap but different feature sets.\\nSo many configuration options make testing impossible.\\n\\nT440 brokeness example. Trackstick uses one driver, touchpad uses a\\ndifferent one. However the touchpad implements soft buttons that\\ninteract with the track stack (e.g. middle button turns track stick into\\nscroll wheel).\\n\\nChanges in wayland <---\\n\\nCompositor takes the role of X server and input modules. Each compositor\\nreimplements evdev, synaptics and wacom. Feature bingo (probability that\\nyour compositor does what you want).\\n)\\nlibinput:\\n  \\n  A librarized version of weston's input management. Almost\\n  feature matched to X.org.\\n  \\n  Pointer acceleration if part of the input library.\\n    Very simple (3 LOC) accelerator works because kernel gives\\n    good timings attached to pointer events (does not need\\n    \\\"ballistic\\\" acceleration algorithm).\\n\\n  Target \\\"user\\\" is the compositor, not the actual user or client.\\n\\n  libinput is not wayland! Could also form the basis of an X.org driver.\\n  \\n  Built-in quirks table (doesn't enable features that don't make sense,\\n  for example T440-like soft buttons)\\n  \\n  Palm detection that works... keithp: \\\"No way\\\"\\n  \\n  Acceleration function copied from X server. Algo. was highly complex.\\n  Performing user study on different user data sets. A 3 LOC solution\\n  worked better.\\n  \\n  Ambitious future plans (including touchpad glyph recognition).\\n\\n== Drawing tablet support in Wayland ==\\n\\nDrawing tablets are weird.\\n  Far richer streams of information, buttons\\n  Complex workflows, multiple tablets, etc\\n\\nAxes at updated by kernel individually but combined into a single axis\\nupdate event when sent to the toolkit.\\n\\n== Waffle ==\\n\\nWaffle could be called SDL-lite. Provides a portable way to get a OpenGL\\ncontext and window... and (currently) nothing else. Not even input handling.\\n\\nWiggle (WGL) is the Windows API to create GL contexts.\\n\\nhttp://www.waffle-gl.org/\\n\\n== UBO ==\\n\\nFuzzing tests to confirm whether a driver conforms to USB std140\\npacking. Apply packing rules in test harness to predict structure\\nlayout.\\n\\nCreate probes using the GL API to generate a shader that probes the\\nfields from the GPU and confirms layout.\\n\\nSome tests which probed *all* structure members \\\"break\\\" the register\\nallocators (>25 minutes to compile a shader program).\\n\\nWhen a bug is found in packing a 300 member structure it is more or less\\nimpossible to debug. Test harness provides an automatic minimizer to\\nreduce the complexity of the test until it *stops* failing.\\n\\n== nVideo performance counters ==\\n\\nFirst... reverse engineer your performance counter registers. Then get\\nGSoC to sponsor you.\\n\\nPCOUNTER blocks are use to sample global counters.\\n\\nOther blocks exist which are context switched (MP, PGRAPH).\\n\\nHow to reverse engineer counters:\\n  Signals are exposed only by perfkit on Windows.\\n  envytools were unavailable on Windows, now fixed with a port of \\n  libpciaccess based on cygwin.\\n\\n== nouveau performance: REclock =\\n\\nX.org \\\"endless vacation of code\\\" project to make nouveau fast!\\n\\nClocking the card right *really* matters for GFX performance:\\n  Boots by default into middle clock range\\n  Too much power consumption (when idle), not enough performance (when needed)\\n\\nRegular reverse engineering:\\n  Copy command queue with a visual means to check that what we tried to\\n  do it what happened.\\n\\nClock reverse engineering:\\n  \\\"Nothing happened but faster\\\"\\n  No visual aids\\n  Occasionally random death tells you its wrong\\n\\nPerformance counters are critical for this because we can count the\\nfrequency of different clocks. Envy tools to decode the video bios\\n(clock modes).\\n\\nTools matter. They help share what is known and illustrate what is not.\\n\\nCurrently targeting older cards (G310, ~five years old). Better\\nunderstood.\\n\\n== AMD Linux driver stack ==\\n\\namdgpu project will unify AMD's Linux drivers -> open-source\\nfoundations, top of stack can either be open source or closed.\\n  \\n  Catalyst will not be open sourced but members of the team will work\\n  upon \\\"new stuff\\\"\\n\\nOptions:\\n  All open\\n  Non-pro\\n  Pro (has FirePro)\\n\\n== Kernel backlight API ==\\n\\nWindows 8 laptops often have broken acpi-video interfaces. Since 3.16\\nkernel uses native interfaces instead.\\n\\nAPI issue 1:\\n  \\n  What is the definition of brightness 0. It is backlight at lowest or\\n  backlight off (also some panels fall over when the backlight is\\n  disabled).\\n  \\n  Suggestion (contentious): Add\\n  Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-cass-backlight that a brightness value\\n  of 0 means lowest possible backlight setting.\\n\\n  Conflicts with ChromeOS (which defined backlight 0 as off due to use\\n  of Intel native driver).\\n  \\nAPI issue 2:\\n\\n  Scales are different. Firmware interfaces use perceived brightness.\\n  Native interfaces is often in linear unit (direct control of PWM\\n  duty cycle).\\n  \\n== Explicit sync ==\\n\\nnvidia tegra graphics team - RFC patchset for dri-devel\\n\\nimplicit versus expicit sync\\n\\nimplicit fences are attached to buffer by kernel, managed automatically\\nbased on buffer read/write.\\n\\nexplicit fences can be passed around independantly of buffers. Kernel\\ntakes/emits fences when accepting work.\\n\\n=== Why? ===\\n\\nImproves performance of bindless graphics APIs\\n  \\n  Bindless GFX is a set of OpenGL extensions that allow a large working\\n  set to be binded in advance. Working set can be shared between\\n  different contexts.\\n\\n  Working sets can be shared between many contexts and command queues.\\n  \\n  ?Not clear to kernel when buffers come alive and die?\\n  \\nBetter alignment with userspace GFX APIs\\n\\n  Developers would like explicit control over driver behaviour. Khronos\\n  lists explicit control for next gen OpenGL as its key design\\n  principle.\\n  \\n  EGLSync/GLSync are explicit sync...\\n  \\n  \\\"Hidden\\\" ordering dependencies and stalls due to implicit sync are at\\n  odds with these design philosophies.\\n\\nUserspace suballocation\\n\\n  Userspace drivers use suballoaction (big texture, many tiny textures\\n  inside. By definition, kernel has no visibility of this. However it\\n  means that we might want to sync small rectangles within the buffer.\\n\\nExplicit interop handoffs\\n\\n  Many specialized engines lying around (video processing, GFX, CPU).\\n  Each has its own caches, compression tricks or other quirks.\\n\\n  When buffers are shared between them, engine specific state\\n  transitions may be needed. May also be *expensive*. Allow the\\n  userspace to schedule this.\\n\\nImplicit versus explicit sync example\\n\\n  See slides and/or video.\\n\\n=== How to get there ===\\n\\nDriver and userspace can together explicitly opt-in (no regressions).\\n\\n=== TODO ===\\n\\n[RFC] Explicit synchronization for Nouveau (+ RFC patches)\\n\\n=== Questions ===\\n\\nAre file descriptors too heavy weight? Could we use a process local\\nhandle and have an import/export to fd (like dma-buf).\\n\\n== X.org foundation status update ==\\n\\nJoin to get benefits. Need to re-join every year.\\n\\n= Day 2 =\\n\\n== Graphics beyond the main compositor ==\\n\\nIssues for bootloader and early boot GFX are very different to fully\\naccelerate desktop graphics.\\n\\nSimple stack is good. Portability is good. Speed is unimportant.\\n\\nClean handover between components has big impact on feel.\\n\\nDebugability is important (need to clear the GFX and see the console).\\nDebug tools include.\\n\\ndrmlog:\\n\\n  modeset on all connected displays\\n\\n  shows logs\\n\\n  multicolumn and 2x/3x/4x scaling for HiDPI screens.\\n\\n  Much simpler than VT layer whilst still allowing the kernel to talk to\\n  the user on panic.\\n\\nsystemd-consoled:\\n\\n  A simple session manager that launches a terminal emulator (and that's\\n  it).\\n\\nsystemd-emergencyd:\\n\\n  Similar to systemd-consoled but tries not to interfere with the\\n  system.\\n\\n=== Every frame is perfect ===\\n\\n=== Software rendering ===\\n\\nSoftware rendering keeps the boot GFX code very simple (and quick to\\nload). KMS \\\"dumb buffers\\\" are a big help for this. memfd is also very\\nhelpful as a means to describe a big buffer with anonymous memory\\nwithout messing about with temporary file systems. Sealing is on its\\nway to make is safe to scan out the data without SEGV.\\n\\n=== Hardware handover ===\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n== Wayland full-screen shell ==\\n\\nWayland motivation -> allow \\\"modern\\\" desktop environments to handle\\ninput and composition themselves.\\n\\nWayland doesn't currently have a good story for non-hardware displays\\n(VNC, FreeRDP). X allows any DDX to be plugged in and run entirely\\nin userspace.\\n\\nScreen recording and sharing is also difficult in Wayland.  Clients are\\nheld at arms length from each other. Other clients cannot jump in a grab\\nscreen images and share on the internet.\\n\\nThe primary compositor (potentially running hardware) can, in addition\\nto its own drawing responsibility, connect as a wayland client to screen\\nsharing or screen shooting application which implements a wayland\\ncompositor.\\n\\nThis extra compositor can be pretty dumb since it need not provide any\\nshell/window management of its own.\\n\\n=== Next steps ===\\n\\n\\\"Easy\\\" compositor can be implemented as a wayland client and punt\\neverything on to weston.\\n\\nUserspace miracast (this is just screen sharing...)\\n\\nMode setting when kernel modules are not an option (nVidia?).\\n\\n=== Questions ===\\n\\n== FreeRDS ==\\n\\nMS RDP protocol. Elderly and \\\"90s tainted\\\" protocol. slow/fast path\\nshows modernity. odd raster operations. some parts of the protocol uses\\ndeeply aggressive bit saving. Other parts are pretty loosely compressed.\\n\\nSpecs are (almost) all public. The reference implementation remains\\nmore authoritive than the specs.\\n\\nFreeRDS is a F/OSS RDP server. New implementation of the protocol.\\nInspired by Xrdp but based on FreeRDP.\\n\\n=== Xrds ===\\n\\nWorks like x11vnc. FreeRDS DDX and based on Xorg 1.15. Links against the\\ncontent provider helper library.\\n\\nMost of the tricks need to improve Xrds (hiding pointer updates, double\\nchecking for damage) are implemented in the FreeRDS library meaning they\\nbenefit other content providers.\\n\\n=== Weston plugin ===\\n\\nPixman rendering, 1 seat, maps RDP layout to XKB layout.\\n\\n== Glamor ==\\n\\nOpenGL based 2D acceleration making it hardware independent. If you\\nhave EGL and GLX.\\n\\n2008 when this was kicked off was a time with \\\"dire\\\" GL support. Drivers\\nwere barely able to cope.\\n\\nGoal of Intel folks was to get good 2d acceleration for hardware where\\nthe blob drivers were all there was. At this point GL was in a much\\nbetter state giving glamor a chance to go faster.\\n\\nGlamor status, as of 2013, was slower than software because the cost of\\nrequesting a drawing action was more expensive than doing it in\\nsoftware (too many function calls).\\n\\nIn 2014, many developers wants to give up on 2D drivers and stopping\\noffering any 2d support except glamor.\\n\\nNasty hacks to work around texture size limits. Really nasty hack (copy\\nout tiles, then copy out seams and paper over the tiling cracks).\\nFirefox hits this since it makes a pixmap for the entire image it has\\nbeen sent and then scales it down with XRENDER.\\n\\nGlamor also has challenges for pixel formats. An X pixmap has not\\nconcept of colour (colour is applied when a pixmap is drawn to a window,\\nwhich has a visual). OpenGL has four channels (they have names but not\\nmeaning).\\n\\nThis isn't so bad when the channels are all the same size (8888).\\nHowever 1010102 is a challenge and must be \\\"converted\\\" by the CPU.\\n\\nGlamor for core X. Goal was to eliminate CPU time spent in Glamor. Use\\nGPU to do the compute. Performs dynamic shader generation since there\\nare too many shader fragments for cover all the crazy stuff.\\n\\nGoogle: Texture swizzle extension.\\n \\n== Particle simulation ==\\n\\nUse of CPU, GPU and OpenCL to perform particle simulations.\\n\\n== StarPU ==\\n\\nSequential loops, annotated with data dependancies. \\\"Unrolling\\\" into\\nparallelism.\\n\\nStar implies the * wildcard, CPU, GPU, SPU, *PU\\n\\nStarPU relies on external libraries (old school) or compilers (new\\nworld).\\n\\n== Scientific visualization ===\\n\\nPython is a major scientific stack. For big data plots matplotlib is\\ngreat for publicication quality images but ... slow.\\n\\nOpenGL is fast, powerful but ... ugly.\\n\\nPicking an OpenGL... too many to choose from. Selected OpenGL ES 2.0\\nbecause its has programmable shaders but is much less complex than\\nOpenGL 4.3 (~4x less complex).\\n\\nStart with SVG2. Use to short circuit API design by copying.\\n\\nTODO: Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (Higher Quality 2d text\\nrendering)\\n\\n== How KWin went XCB ==\\n\\nKWin is used not only by KDE but also by a number of LXDE/LXQT users.\\n\\nMotivated by QT5 requiring moving away from X11 (to add Wayland, Mir,\\netc). Broke a lot of KWin assumptions. Huge porting challenge\\n\\nQT4 -> X event; QT5 -> XCB events\\n\\nThe right way to find the up2date docs:\\n\\nx.org -> X11R7.7 -> releases -> documentation\\n[don't follow documentation links]\\n\\nDeath by 1000 cuts.\\n\\nHeaders not working in C++ was a big deal.\\n\\nTODO: librfn \\\"make check\\\" with C++ compiler?\\n\\n== Wayland and security ==\\n\\nComplete mediation (client isolation, all the way up and down the\\nstack, sandboxing).\\n\\nLeast privilege\\n\\nTrusted path (unspoofable ways to user and trusted apps to communicate)\\n\\nMany GUI concepts are intrinsically un-secure (e.g. clipboard) or have\\ngood/bad aspects\\n  \\n  Android is especially bad for this (password managers must use\\n  clipboard but clipboard is accessible by web interfaces)\\n \\n  Focus raising is needed to seek user input, bad if very small window\\n  to steal keyboard focus to steal password\\n\\nX11: One good use case -> access to everyone\\nWayland: One *bad* use case -> deny to everyone\\n\\nWayland security modules:\\n\\n  Inspired by Linux security modules\\n\\n  Allows one framework and multiple policy engines (SELinux, AppArmour)\\n  \\nPermissions are: deny, soft-deny, soft-allow, allow.\\n\\n  Soft forms implement some type of compositor specific user\\n  notification or decision making.\\n\\n== Night out ==\\n\\nTODO: GBM\\n\\n= Day 3: ... =\\n\\n== Tizen and wayland ==\\n\\nTizen wants display security. Tizen can build packages for either\\nXorg+enlightenment or weston+tizen-launcher. X11 is \\\"legacy\\\". Results in\\nseperate X11 and wayland RPM repositories.\\n\\nTizen common. Looks like desktop (standard WM, Chromium, crosswalk, Qt)\\n\\nTizen IVI. Home screen, full screen apps except for top bar to choose\\nbetween apps. OCL shell?\\n\\nWhat do we expect of wayland?\\n\\n  Tizen: HTML5 (open web) and APIs (QT?)\\n\\n  XDG shell: Wayland compositor is not able to raise and lower in an IVI\\n  manner (full-screenish)\\n\\nIVI-Shell:\\n\\n  In review upstream. Provides a GENIVI compliant Weston shell\\n  interface.\\n\\n  Has compatibility layer with XDG-Shell so that standard applications\\n  can use it.\\n\\nTizen IVI requires multi-seat support:\\n\\n  Rear user windows must appear on the rear seat.\\n\\nQ: Why introduce a new window hinting standard for Tizen? WMHINTS do\\n   this already.\\n\\n== FreeBSD ==\\n\\nFreeBSD fell behind when KMS became mandatory on Linux (and X.org).\\nIn 2012 FreeBSD foundation needed to catch up.\\n\\nVarious drivers ported from Linux and adapted for FreeBSD kernel.\\nHowever the code was reworked too aggressively making it too difficult\\nto merge in new changes from Linux.\\n\\nNew approach. Use wrapper APIs to make porting and reporting much\\neasier.\\n\\nSmall team, big version jumps, users are \\\"afraid\\\" of change.\\n\\n== DragonflyBSD ==\\n\\nFreeBSD fork circa 2003 focussed on scalability and high performance.\\nGood peak results for PostgresSQL.\\n\\nInteresting features such as HAMMER filesystem and swapcache (swapcache\\nallows unused swap on fast disks to be used as file system cache).\\n\\nSimilar issues for FreeBSD (because that is who they copied). Turned out\\nOpenBSD had the best *BSD support for DRM., for example on SSD, \\n\\n== OpenBSD ==\\n\\nOpenBSD had many advantaged w.r.t. modern graphics:\\n\\n  X was part of the base rather than in ports\\n\\n  Most arch already support bitmap consoles (since OpenBSD is ported\\n  to architectures with VGA character generation). This means KMS was\\n  baked in to some extent.\\n\\n  Security mindset means high motivation to persue a unprivalidged X\\n  server.\\n  \\n  Aggressive in persuit of non-GPL compiler... (LLVM -> Gallium)\\n\\nNouveau will be a challenge because OpenBSD users have been \\\"trained\\\"\\nnot to by nVidia (undocumented). This means few developers have access\\nto such hardware.\\n\\n== OpenGL ABI ==\\n\\nCommon ABI to make it possible for OpenGL implementations to coexist on\\nthe same filesystem and even in the same process (c.f. OpenCL?).\\n\\nVendor neutral API libraries. libOpenGL provides symbols for OpenGL 4.4\\n(or OpenGL 4.5).\\n\\nVendor can register additional entrypoints through eglGetProcAddress.\\n\\nlib{EGL,GLX}_${VENDOR}.so.1\\n\\n  Init function\\n\\n  No name collisions with vendor neutral libraries.\\n\\nDispatch to vendor libraries:\\n\\n  Window system APIs have to parse sufficiently to infer the vendor.\\n\\n  Once you have a context it becomes quite easy.\\n\\nTODO: ELF DT_FILTER?\\n\\nlibglvnd (OpenGL Vendor Neutral Dispatch) -> on github\\nx11vnd?\\n\\n== nVidia wayland/mir stuff ==\\n\\nKMS: Refactoring display programming support (ready to be a KMS driver)\\n\\n  Won't be used by blob driver (so it stays working on older systems)\\n\\nX11-less EGL:\\n\\n  nVidia use same OpenGL implementation for all GPUs (discrete and\\n  Tegra)\\n\\nTODO: GBM?, gbm_create_device?\\n\\nGBM provides the platform from which to bootstrap X11-less EGL by\\nproviding a platform for the compositor.\\n\\nEGL_EXT_output_drm maps DRM KMS to EGL objects.\\n\\n=== EGL streams ===\\n\\nTODO: EGL streams\\n\\nConsuming a texture ticks the decoder? Explicit producers and consumers.\\n\\nIf the OpenGL driver knows what procudes and consumes it can select\\noptimal memory formats or auxiliary resources.\\n\\nExplicit handover between producers and consumers can resolve\\nsync/cohereny requirements.\\n\\nIf we track consumers correctly we can do tricks like deferring\\ndownsampling (allowing hand off from GPU to display hardware).\\n\\nQ: Why use wl_buffer? wl_surface is a better thing to link to an EGL\\n   stream. \\n\\nEGL, being embedded, provides a model of planes and outputs?\\n\\n== GLSL compiler =\\n\\nTODO: Get the right GFX card in the \\\"next\\\" laptop.\\n\\nGLSL 3.3 capable (sandybridge)\\n\\nIntel driver has poor IR (tree based) for many parts. i965 has better\\nIR. Recognise need for SSA based IR.\\n\\nTesting: Benchmarking games is tedious and exhibits too much\\nvariability. apitraces remove variability but is too unrealistic.\\nOptimization are (individually) to small to measure in f.p.s.\\n\\nNote: A years worth of improvements is a different thing. 17% of the\\n      generated code is gone!\\n      \\nshader-db\\n\\n  Collected shaders gather from many games and benchmarks and have\\n  scripts to compile them and collect stats (often just code size but\\n  also cyclomatic complexity).  Nearly 20,000 shaders gathered from real\\n  games etc.\\n\\n  Public version has redistributable shaders (not tested to see whether\\n  the redistributable shaders follow the same trend pattern as the\\n  large corpus of commercial material).\\n\\n  Quick and easy to check whether an optimization helps or hurts real\\n  applications.\\n  \\nDirectX9 has no square root so when someone needs that something quite\\nfunky gets handed to the compiler.\\n\\n=== New IR for Mesa ===\\n\\nFrom LIMA guy.\\n\\nSSA-based, avoid excessive wacky hardware opcodes.\\n\\nWhy not LLVM IR? Vectorization? The \\\"vec 4 model\\\"?\\n\\nMasked writes are not possible in SSA whilst modelling the \\\"atom\\\" as a\\nvec4.

But it breaks Actions kernel. I'll write the status in\\n     Actions' card.\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Upgrade MCU firmware and stub clock driver [Leo]\\n   (PSE-24)\\n   - inquired Rob Herring for idle state patches on IRC and got\\n     feedback. But still cannot finalize it if without Mark Rutland's\\n     confirmation.\\n   - Discussing with Mark Rutland for if we can simply to just use\\n     /memory-reserved/ node; he still takes option to not use it and\\n     should use memory node to curve out unused memory regions; which\\n     is conflict with Rob Herring's option. It's hard to move forward\\n     when two maintainers have no alignment on this.\\n\\n * Linaro: EAS and IPA familiarization [Leo] (PSE-6)\\n   - Finished slides of \\\"EAS profiling on Hikey\\\" and send to eas-dev\\n     mailing list for reviewing. Got comments and suggestions from\\n     power management team and refined slides according to them.\\n   - Investigating test case rt-app-31 unstable issue. Have found\\n     several errors in current EAS will introduce wrong energy\\n     calculation and worked on them; further more there still have two\\n     obvious errors which need to check: one error is CPU's load\\n     tracking parameters utilization_load_avg and\\n     utilization_blocked_avg both are zero, even there have tasks just\\n     run on the CPU, this will introduce big deviation when calculate\\n     energy; another error is EAS have not considered the situation\\n     for how to spread tasks so that can use lower OPP.\\n   - For USB on ethernet issue, tried to use rk3288's DT binding and\\n     found it can work well on hikey.

But still, the connections from linux client\\n     always are alive. Just the connections from windows get lost.\\n     Need further check.\\n   - Nico reported the wifi mac address is created randomly instead of\\n     follow the serial num from bootload if boot the debian system 1st\\n     time. It turned out that the macaddr0 file is created after the\\n     wifi driver tried to load  it.\\n   - The fix was decouple the systemd service which create the\\n     macaddr0 file with the wcnss smd channel uevent because there is\\n     no dependency between them.

The impact of your technical work for Hikey\\npower management was a particularly important contribution, given the\\nthermal overcommit for this platform. The training courses you have\\nput together since joining the team has also been extremely well\\nregarded, inside and outside of Linaro, both for their quality and in\\nmany cases also for being assembled from scratch so rapidly. I have been\\nespecially pleased to see your commitment, throughout your recent EAS\\nactivities, to deliver value back to members in the form of training\\nas well as through your technical contributions.\\n\\n # @yfw managers comment\\n\\nA very good six months.\\n\\nAll of your work thus far has required you to\\novercome obstacles that are not easy to navigate. Whether it\\nhas been the painstaking work to bring the Wifi alive, ensuring member\\nneeds are communicated within the working groups or the difficult\\nwork of trying to deliver a member build for an under-resourced\\nmember, you have continued to push forward towards a conclusion. This\\ndetermination to succeed is very good to see. \\n\\nIn addition the initiative you have shown, particular on behalf of \\nSpreadtrum, is much appreciated. I have noted both the effort you have \\nput in both to pass critical feedback, such as the LCR performance \\nregressions, to the right people and to raise awareness within \\nSpreadtrum of the value our services can provide.\\n\\n # Monthly report\\n\\n * Describe why the second pie chart covers only the Aug-Sep period.\\n * Don't commentate on data not presented in the graphs (or when we\\n   do don't make it appear that we are).\\n * Why such a large quantity of work applied to TI?

The problem is that\\n     the platform related stuff were enabled in u-boot other than\\n     kernel. After switching to correct u-boot, I hit the exactly same\\n     issue as Rob.\\n   - Double verified the dependency for wifi functionality, we found\\n     that the exteranl 32k clock behavior is not as what we thought.\\n     Whatever it's on or off, we could see the same problem (fw\\n     download operation is done. But firmware didn't report correct\\n     status). It's not aligned with what we expected. Rob sent the\\n     question to Marvell interface. But no response yet.\\n   - I also did the test to check the fw status after every chunk if\\n     firmware downloading. The status only changed to 0xf005 after the\\n     whole firmware downloading done. My gut feeling is the firmware\\n     downloading is ok. But starting firmware on wifi module failed\\n     somehow and the fw status is set to 0xf005. We need mroe support\\n     from Marvell wifi team here.\\n\\n * Actions: Provisioning/debrick tools for Bubblegum-96 [Paul] (PSE-8)\\n   - Mimic the Windows tool's usb protocol under Linux.\\n   - Extract binaries from log and firmware file.\\n   - Compare the binaries from Windows tool.\\n \\n * BSP Analysis: Audio driver BSP analaysis and upstreaming\\n   consultancy [Daniel] (PSE-25)\\n   - Poked Taiten to ensure analysis is forwarded Mediatek (Taiten has\\n     been out-of-office for his wedding).

The lockdep callbacks run in a peculiar\\n     calling context, with the NMI is masked but with the kernel not\\n     yet informed it is handling an interrupt, so we need extra state\\n     tracking to prevent the self-consistanch checks from firing.\\n\\n * MediaTek: Upstream training for MediaTek [Leo] (PSE-12)\\n   - Have recieved VISA for Taiwan.\\n\\n * MediaTek: Audio driver BSP analaysis and upstreaming consultancy\\n   [Daniel] (PSE-25)\\n   - Poked Taiten to ensure analysis is forwarded Mediatek (Taiten has\\n     been out-of-office for his wedding).

I have\\n      retained a patch at the send of the series to nix alternative_insn\\n      but there's no need to take this one for 4.3. Likewise I've fully\\n      split out all the switch-over patches so you can just drop them\\n      if they bring any merge trouble.\\n\\nThe existing alternative_insn macro has some limitations that make it\\nhard to work with. In particular the fact it takes instructions from it\\nown macro arguments means it doesn't play very nicely with C pre-processor\\nmacros because the macro arguments look like a string to the C\\npre-processor. Workarounds are (probably) possible but things start to\\nlook ugly.\\n\\nThis patchset introduces new macros that allow instructions to be\\npresented to the assembler as normal and overcomes these limitations,\\ntogether with patches to switch all existing users to the new macros.\\n\\nMy view is that these if_not/else/endif macros are more readable\\nthan the original macro and that alone might be enough to justify them.\\nHowever below is an concrete example of an alterntive sequence that is\\nneedlessly hard to write without them because ICC_PMR_EL1 is a C\\npre-processor macro.\\n \\t\\n \\t.macro\\tdisable_irq, tmp\\n \\tmov\\t\\\\tmp, #ICC_PMR_EL1_MASKED\\nalternative_if_not ARM64_HAS_SYSREG_GIC_CPUIF\\n\\tmsr\\tdaifset, #2\\nalternative_else\\n \\tmsr_s\\tICC_PMR_EL1, \\\\tmp\\nalternative_endif\\n\\t.endm\\n\\nThe new macros have received a fair degree of testing because I have\\nbased my (not published since March) pseudo-NMI patch set on them.\\n\\nv3:\\n\\n * Corrected some technical and spelling errors in the comments\\n   (Will Deacon).\\n\\nv2:\\n\\n * Split big patch out into atomized components (Will Deacon).\\n   To show where I would like to go I have retained a patch to remove\\n   assembler_insn() from the code base although, based on Will's email\\n   I don't anticipate this patch being taken for 4.3.\\n\\n * Add some comments to make clear the constraints imposed on alternative\\n   sequences.\\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--to \\\"Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc patches@linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc linaro-kernel@lists.linaro.org \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Sumit Semwal <sumit.semwal@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@linaro.org>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cc \\\"Andre Przywara <andre.przywara@arm.com>\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix=\\\"PATCH v3\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--signoff --find-renames --cover-letter -5\\n\\nv1: <1436536130-31438-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv2: <1437405004-1296-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\nv3: <1437564065-4356-1-git-send-email-daniel.thompson@linaro.org>\\n\" }\n",

Is a USB controlled\\n(and powered) bank of relays assembled from cheap boards that can be \\npurchased from ebay. The total cost a controller board and a bank of \\neight relays is about £6.50 (or $10 USD if you prefer to count like\\nthat).\\n\\nThe controller board is an STM32F103C8T6 breakout board, this board\\nprovides the USB hardware and ARM Cortex M3 CPU combined with enough\\nFLASH and on-board RAM to make writing software easy. These terrific\\nlittle boards can be found on eBay for a whisker over £3 and are just\\nperfect for hacking together all kinds of USB toys and tools (some of\\nwhich may be the subject to further blog posts).\\n\\nTODO: Image\\n\\nThe only other component needed is the relay board and a bunch of jumper\\nwires. Relay boards can be bought in single, dual, quad or octo \\nconfigurations depending the complexity of your projects.\\n\\nTODO: Image\\n\\nI use this project to automate things on my rather modest pool of\\ndevelopment boards and definitely need all eight relays (and then some).\\nMy relays control power delivery and, for some boards, they are also\\nused to automate changes to jumper configuration. The HiSilicon HiKey\\nboard (from 96Boards.org) is especially needy in this department. To \\nautomatically test its debrick/recovery process requires three relays.\\nOne for power control and a further two to manipulate the jumper\\nconfiguration.\\n\\nThe completed system is fully USB powered with the relay board taking a \\n5V feed from the controller. Eight relays can be pretty hungry when they\\nare all energised at once but we do just about manage to sneak in below\\nthe 500mA USB current limit.\\n\\nTODO: Image\\n\\nSo... the hardware in this build is very simple and can be assembled by\\nsomeone with no electronics knowledge. What about the software?\\n\\nThere is a complete firmware for the device which can be FLASHed to the \\ncontroller board without much fuss. The firmware presents a simple command\\ninterpretter as part of a CDC/ADM class compliant device. This allows\\nthe device to operate without drivers on more or less any operating system. \\n\\n~~~\\n> help\\nAvailable commands:\\n  echo\\n  id\\n  help\\n  reboot\\n  relay1\\n  relay2\\n  relay3\\n  relay4\\n  relay5\\n  relay6\\n  relay7\\n  relay8\\n  uptime\\n  version\\n> relay1\\nUsage: relay1 on|off|toggle|pulse\\n> relay1 on\\n> relay1 off\\n> \\n~~~\\n\\nLike any command interpreter the firmware can be automatically driven\\nusing an expect-like system. However on GNU/Linux (and I suspect any other\\nUnix-like OS) it is sufficient just to hurl commands at the device node\\nusing shell scripts:\\n\\n~~~\\necho relay1 on > /dev/ttyACM0\\n~~~\\n\\nThe firmware has a couple of extra bits of polish to make it more\\npractical. In particular the unique serial number embedded into all\\nSTM32 devices during manufacturing is extracted and persented as the\\nUSB serial number. This allows udev to be configured to recognise\\nspecific devices and give them stable device names regardless of any\\nrearrangements of the USB bus topology. This allows a single host PC to\\n(reliably) support a very large number of relays.\\n\\nThe firmware consists of a bootloader and the main image. The bootloader\\ncan be downloaded either using the UART bootloader included in the ROM\\nof almost all STM32 devices, however I prefer to hook up an ST-Link\\n(thee are also easily found on eBay) to the controller boards JTAG\\npins to FLASH to bootloader. Once the bootloader is in place its easy\\nto install the main image using a DFU programmer such as dfu-util.\\nAfter the main image has been installed the device will enumerate as\\na CDC/ACM device and is ready to use. Once the main image is installed\\nit will launch automatically but pressing the reset button will force\\nthe device back into DFU mode ready for a firmware update.\\n\\nMore information on how to install the firmware see\\nhttp://github.com/daniel-thompson/usb-relay.git\\n\\nFinally to close I would really like to thank all the folks who work \\non libopencm3. The USB code in usb-relay comes from libopencm3 and\\nwithout it then usb-relay probably wouldn't exist.\\n\" }\n",

Both to improve the experience for downstream\\nconsumers and for developers that come after us.\\n\\nIf your patch changes something unrelated to the contents of the commit\\nmessage a mainainter will want to know why (or may just tell you to\\nmove it to another patch).\\n\\n## Slide 5\\n\\nReference: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1591772\\n\\nIncidentally, there is nothing abridged in this comment (although Ingo\\ndoes respond to other parts of the patch.\\n\\nOn LKML: Directness != Rudeness\\n\\n## Slide 6\\n\\nTake a note of the multi-tier patch comment.

After asking a question the submitter\\nsent an improved v3 that Mark applied.\\n\\nArguably Mark is being kind in reposting his original comment and   problem here. Ignoring\\ncomments is one of the quickest ways to get NAKed-by: .\\n\\n## Slide 8\\n\\nhttp://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/87458/focus=87479\\n\\nQuestions are ok if you don't follow the feedback. In this particular\\ncase the patch submitter exchanges quite a few short mails, including\\nlots of tentative example code to test understanding. He made it\\neasier for the maintainer to help him.\\n\\n## Slide 9\\n\\nIf you agree. Show that you agree.\\n\\nYou like it \\n\\n\\n## Slide 10\\n\\nhttp://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.hardware.netbook.arm/6535/focus=6581\\n\\nThis is a rather extreme example of a common sentiment: why won't you\\nmerge working code? Because working isn't good enough... we have to be\\nable to maintain it for the long haul.\\n\\nIn the end its not professional behaviour and has invisible\\nrepercussions (you remember the mail filtering I talked about).\\n\\nNote that even though this is an extreme example at least there's no top\\nposting ;-)\\n\\n## Slide 15\\n\\nAnother interesting note here is that both these developers work for the\\nsame company and their reviews of publically posted code are also\\npublic.\\n\\n## Slide 19\\n\\nThis example is working with a very simple driver. Watchdogs are simple\\nand aren't usually very exotic.\\n\\nThe history of patchsets is easy to find with a search engine. One of\\nthe best ways to find out how to divide things up is to copy what has\\ncome before.\\n\\n## Slide 21\\n\\nI've not got a slide up here to tell you to run git send-email *.patch!\\nThat's definitely the way I'd choose to send patches, its automated and\\ngets the threading right. The reason its not shown is because I want to\\nask you a question instead... when do *you* want to run checkpatch on\\nyour work? Do you want to run final build checks on it?\\n\\n## Slide 24\\n\\nMarkus got a lot of comments. It will take a little while to process\\nall that so we see a \\\"Will fix\\\" acknowledgement for the reviewer.\\n\\n## Slide 26\\n\\nv5: Not that unusual. Drivers for simple hardware often go through lots\\n    of iterations.\\n\\nThis an also example of a maintainer going the extra mile. The original\\ncode included some conditional features the maintainer didn't like and\\nit was late in the merge window. The maintainer ripped out the features\\nthemselves so the patch could go in. Don't expect maintainers to do that\\nfor you. Its much better to strip down a driver and defer complex or\\ncontroversial features until basic support is accepted.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n## When you add code/feature what is the test responsiblity\\n\\nVaries from sub-system to sub-system. If there is a test suite the\\nmaintainer might ask you to run it.\\n\\nI like to say what testing has been performed in the cover letter.\\n\\nIf you haven't run checkpatch.pl then you'll (eventually) get caught.\\n\\n## Filtering the output of get_maintainers.pl\\n\\nSlide for this?\\n\\nget_maintainers.pl searches MAINTAINERS but also works through\\ngit history looking for active developers. It is useful to Cc:\\nactive developers.\\n\\n## Is there a sane mailer for Android?\\n\\nNo!\\n\" }\n",

Have finished code in kernel for dumping coresight meta data\\n     dumping and wrote code for Crash tool extension to extract\\n     dumping data and generate 'perf' compatible format so can use\\n     'perf' analyse the flow.\\n   - Have sent out patch set v2 to LKML and followed up for comments\\n     and discussion from ML;\\n   - Have modified code according to comments and verified the\\n     complete process for kdumping and crash analysis;\\n   - Have root caused the symbol loading issue with tool \\\"perf\\\",\\n     before perf couldn't load kernel symbol properly with a corrupted\\n     kallsyms file. And if \\\"perf\\\" tool build with \\\"libelf\\\", it can\\n     directly load symbol with vmlinux file.\\n   - Polished Coresight panic kdump patch set v3 and sent to LKML for\\n     reviewing;\\n   - Verified mainline kernel + Coresight Perf decoder patches +\\n     OpenCSDv0.8.0 libs building; root caused two issues for tracing\\n     data decoding, and sent to mailing list for that.\\n   - Found two regressions, one bug in coresight debug module and sent\\n     patch which has been merged into mainline kernel; another bug is\\n     perf failed to import vmlinux symbols with option '-k', sent\\n     patch and tested more neat patch from Redhat.\\n   - Following the discussion at HKG18 connect with Mathieu, reworked\\n     Coresight panic kdump patch set v4 and sent to LKML, and updated\\n     corresponding crash extension program.\\n   - Looked into Perf file format and refined crash extension program\\n     for more simple fashion by removing buildid, dummy event, and\\n     thread info.\\n   - Have updated crash extension program csdump to use perf headers\\n     and macros for more readable.\\n   - Investigated perf python script for CoreSight trace disassembler,\\n     and developed the script to parse CoreSight trace data; so now it\\n     can support both 'perf record' and panic kdump trace data.  Sent\\n     patch set to Mathieu for private reviewing and sent to the\\n     mailing list for RFT.\\n   - Sent patches to fix unknown_thread NULL pointer issue for\\n     CoreSight auxtrace code, the patches have been merged into\\n     mainline kernel next branch.\\n   - Sent out CoreSight disassembler patch series RFT v2/v3, and\\n     consolidated with ARM's Rob for handling CS_TRACE_ON packet.\\n   - According to Mathieu suggestion, re-spined patches RFT v4 and\\n     sent three rounds to the Coresight mailing list for ARM/Linaro\\n     preview.\\n   - Sent patch series 'perf cs-etm: Fix tracing packet handling and\\n     minor refactoring' to LKML and got the green light from Mathieu.\\n   - Reported by Spreadtrum engineer now the Coresight doesn't support\\n     CPU suspend/resume flow for Coresight 'sysfs' mode; discussed\\n     this with Mathieu and we think this is a valid user case to be\\n     supported and need take it as low priority after Coresight kdump\\n     integration.\\n   - Discussed with Mathieu, it's good to prototype to use OpenCSD lib\\n     with crash extension program for tracing data parsing.  If this\\n     is valid we can directly dump tracing data without generating\\n     synthetic perf format file. Working on this (20%).\\n   - Have finished the Crash extension program to integrate OpenCSD\\n     lib, so now can directly decode Coresight tracing data with Crash\\n     tool.\\n   - Reported by Mathieu the building failure for linking OpenCSD\\n     libs, so tweaked the building progress to firstly install OpenCSD\\n     on system and then link OpenCSD from system lib path.  This can\\n     work both for x86 and ARM buildings.\\n   - Sent patch series 'perf cs-etm: Fix tracing packet handling and\\n     minor refactoring' v2 to LKML to keep it warm.\\n   - Read the TRM for ETM tracing for memory accessing.\\n   - Have some discussion with Mathieu for following up Coresight\\n     kdump patch set, need to following up below items for moving\\n     forward:\\n   - Understand Intel PT + write doc for it;\\n   - Verifiy STM with kdump on one board;\\n   - Enabled kdump on DB410c and Juno r2 with installation Debian\\n     'Brute' root FS; enabled and verified kdump with ETM and STM\\n     trace data on mainline kernel on these two platforms, also\\n     verified crash extension program for decoding ETM and STM trace\\n     data from kernel dump file.\\n   - Enabled Intel PT with kdump on an x86 laptop, also verified crash\\n     extension program ptdump.so can work well on the laptop for\\n     decoding PT trace data.  Studied Intel PT PMU driver and crash\\n     extension code, and finished the doc for Intel PT related\\n     implementation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pc5bsfzUBLbd5\\n     rMx4StxOHcU7fhC2vr2cpE62ZKWYSI/edit?usp=sharing\\n   - Worked out patch series v5 and shared with Mathieu for reviewing.\\n     The patch series v5 supports ETM perf mode, ETM SysFS mode and\\n     STM SysFS mode.\\n   - Heavily refactored crash extension program to support perf ring\\n     buffer and extract metadata from driver data structure and\\n     totally removed metadata dedicated structures.\\n   - Shared STM enabling and snapshot method on CoreSignt ML with\\n     Christophe (ST); shared two captured trace data with Mike for\\n     decoding failure analysis.\\n   - Worked out 3 fixing patches for ETM perf ring buffer and sent to\\n     the CoreSight mailing list for review.\\n   - According to Mathieu suggestion, simplified CoreSight Kdump patch\\n     series v5 by removing support STM/ETM with SysFS mode.\\n   - Refactored crash extension program.\\n   - Though before have enabled mainline kernel on Juno-r2 board, but\\n     Juno-r2 board have two issues with mainline kernel: one issue is\\n     usb stick is unstable and seldomly disconnect from bus; the\\n     second issue is CoreSight components cannot register\\n     successfully;\\n   - Did bisection and narrowed down mailbox patches are missed for\\n     Juno board on mainline kernel; found two reasons for usb stick\\n     instability issue, one is to disable USB bus autosuspend; another\\n     is to USB hub with external power supply.

IOMMU\\n   - The camera_v2 driver directly plays with the iommu via call to\\n     arm_iommu* or msm_iommu*. These functions don't exist with arm-\\n     smmu and arm64. Actually this is abstracted by the dma-mapping\\n     layer which can be backed by iommu or non-iommu devices.\\n     Typically, in the device tree, a device can reference a iommu\\n     phandle. Then iommu is automatically attached to the device and\\n     to the dma ops during DT parsing. The driver does not have to\\n     manage iommu anymore and just has to perform regular dma\\n     operations. This has big impact on the camera v2 architecture\\n     which strongly relies on this manual iommu management (cf\\n     cam_ssmmu_api.c).\\n   - For now I'm not sure if we have to change the whole driver to use\\n     abstracted iommu solution or try to port the old arm_iommu\\n     helpers to minimize camera_v2 changes.

John Stultz reports there have resetting is caused by thermal on\\n     Android common kernel 4.9 on Hikey, so took time to verify\\n     thermal can work well in ACK 4.9.\\n   - Verified the Linux-next branch is broken on Hikey, and used\\n     bisect to root cause the patch \\\"[PATCH] initramfs: make initramfs\\n     honor CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT\\\" caused the booting failure. Reported\\n     the bug on LKML.\\n   - Have reworked PSCI code for Hikey, the code is used for Hikey\\n     upstreaming and have been merged into ARM-TF mainline code.\\n   - John Stultz reported the GPU benchmark poor performance and I\\n     reproduced this issue;\\n   - After applied GPU devfreq driver with higher OPP still saw the\\n     performance issue: ~1200 scores with kernel normal setting, ~1400\\n     scores with thermal disabling. Have shared testing result with\\n     Hisilicon.\\n   - Per Guodong's request, finished verification work to accelerate\\n     UEFI+ARM-TF adoption in AOSP. Have delivered the testing reports\\n     to LMG and Guodong, so far except LED and a seldom USB panic, the\\n     fundamental functionalities work well with UEFI+ARM-TF.\\n   - Debugged WALT panic cases for Hikey960, there has one erratum\\n     should be applied on CA73 CPUs; and discussed in eas-dev mailing\\n     list there has a missed WALT patch should be applied on kernel;\\n     verified the patch can fix the WALT panic issue.\\n   - Enabled per-CPU buffer for pstore for debugging the CPU lockup\\n     issue; narrowed down the lockup issue is related with CA73's\\n     highest OPP 2.3GHz, and with Daniel suggestion using shell script\\n     can easily reproduce the lockup issue.\\n   - Have enabled watchdog driver on Hikey/Hikey960, and sent related\\n     patches for upstreaming mainline kernel.\\n   - Supported Daniel Lezcano for Hikey thermal driver reworking,\\n     Daniel is starting thermal related work on Hikey and found there\\n     have many places can be improved. So provided some background\\n     info when I wrote the driver.\\n   - Have committed Hikey coresight DT patch and clock fixing patch to\\n     LKML; the coresight clock fixing patch has been ACKed by clock\\n     maintainer.\\n   - Reviewed and tested Daniel Lezcano's 13 patches for Hikey thermal\\n     driver.\\n   - Tested several patches from Kevin to narrow down the hang issue\\n     and finally found the hang issue is related with \\\"on-chip LDO\\\";\\n     after disabled OCLDO the hang issue can totally dismiss. Kevin\\n     will update a new MCU firmware for the fixing.\\n   - Backported patch \\\"arm64: arch_timer: Workaround for Cortex-A73\\n     erratum 858921\\\" for stable kernel, but Marc reviewed the patch\\n     and suggested to port the complete patch series rather than\\n     single patch.\\n   - Pinged Alex to check if Alex can take the backporting task for\\n     erratum 858921; but Alex suggested me to firstly port this series\\n     to stable kernel then he can backport to LSK.\\n   - According to github reporting, found sec_xloader.bin/mcu.img have\\n     hang issue. I tried it with UEFI/ARM-TF and reproduced it as\\n     well. Finally Haojian reverted the latest images in github and\\n     track this issue on 96boards bugzilla.\\n   - Verified latest video blob binaries on latest Android master\\n     branch, so this is consistent with Vishal at his side finding,\\n     the video blob binaries have compatible issue with latest Android\\n     master branch due video blob binaries have used Hisilicon gralloc\\n     lib but master branch uses open sourced gralloc lib.\\n   - Found two regressions on Linux mainline kernel for Hikey; the\\n     first one issue is related with Coresight debugging module cannot\\n     dump for panic, have sent patch and wait for Mark/Mathiue's\\n     comment. The another issue is related with kernel panic after\\n     enable VMAP_STACK option, finally found this is very likely\\n     related with CPU errata, after changed to use latest ARM-TF with\\n     CPU errata fixing, the kernel panic dismisses.\\n   - ARM Robin pinged me the fip.bin for uboot stucks with fastboot\\n     downloading, I can reproduce this issue at my side.\\n   - Root caused Hikey ARM-fastboot stuck issue, it's caused by the\\n     image size for fip.bin including u-boot.bin is not 64 bytes\\n     alignment, so DMA transferring cannot accomplish successfully.\\n     Shared temporary fixing with ARM Robin Randhawa.\\n   - Per Sahaj requirement, added DT binding for thermal multiple\\n     sensors for his experiment for VR HAL enabling in Android.\\n   - Hangouted with Valentin for Hikey960 energy modeling, we finally\\n     agreed to power modeling data based on with fan and fixing DDR to\\n     400MHz. Verified Valentin patch from gerrit and has been merged;\\n     so this is good for later optimization.\\n   - Reviewed and verified Kevin Wang patch for GPU clock fixing for\\n     4.9 kernel.\\n   - Root caused Hikey960 \\\"CPU_NAP\\\" idle state frequently\\n     entering/exiting issue, and sent patches to ARM-TF and LKML\\n     respectively; ARM-TF patch has been approved by ARM maintainer\\n     (in testing process);\\n   - Fixed ramoops bug on Hikey960 android-4.9 kernel: wrongly dt\\n     binding;\\n   - Sent patch for ARM-TF for fiptool.c to pack alignment size so can\\n     avoid usb downloading stuck issue (on Hikey/Hikey960 both needs\\n     to 512B alignment for downloading image size); and shared the\\n     reproduce steps for this issue for ARM maintainer so can help\\n     them to reproduce this issue at their side (Thanks a log for\\n     Haojian for many detailed discussions and Vee for building\\n     fip.bin+uboot scripts preparation for ARM team).\\n   - Investigated the Hikey960 bug: \\\"Kernel crash on idle state exit\\\"\\n     (https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614), verified the\\n     watchdog can work well and reboot system at my side with\\n     Hisilicon legacy booting images and UEFI/ARM-TF. But I cannot\\n     reproduce Valentine reported backtrace issue, by only analysis\\n     Valentine kernel log, it's quite likely the watchdog interrupt\\n     has been configured as FIQ and cannot trigger the system reset.\\n   - Invested time for bug\\n     https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614 for two working\\n     items:\\n   - I can reproduce once with Hisilicon legacy boot images but cannot\\n     reproduce it with UEFI/ARM-TF, confirmed the ARM-TF has set\\n     watchdog interrupt to group 1 as non-secure interrupt. And this\\n     bug doesn't block Valentin's development after disabling watchdog\\n     driver. So would like to take this bug as not urgent;\\n   - This bug is annoying due the kernel reports the panic by FIQ but\\n     kernel has no permission to access GICv2 secure registers so we\\n     cannot get know which interrupt is triggered as secure interrupt\\n     and introduce kernel panic. So enabled ARM-TF exception handling\\n     framework (EHF) with EL3 interrupt handling, so can easily get to\\n     know which interrupt number is culprit. The EHF can be easily\\n     disabled by building configuration if we enable OP-TEE on\\n     Hikey960: https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-\\n     firmware/pull/1209 https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-\\n     firmware/pull/1210\\n   - Per ARM-TF team requirement, verified the patch for padding zero\\n     on the tail of fip;\\n   - Helped Haojian to verify UEFI for supporting compressed kernel\\n     image booting.\\n   - Took time to investigate the GPU performance poor issue on\\n     Android common kernel 4.9; compared ARM GPU driver r7p0 for 4.9\\n     kernel and GPU driver r4p0 for 4.4 kernel, after port 4.4 kernel\\n     into 4.9 kernel code base but GPU performance has no improvement.\\n     Shared all info and trace log file to mailing list hikey-\\n     collaboration@lists.linaro.org.\\n   - Sent power management DT binding patch series to LKML for\\n     Hikey960.\\n   - Verified Hikey960 4G DDR patch and committed the patch to github.\\n   - Engaged the debugging work for Hikey display horizontal offset\\n     issue, assisted Haojian to compare old ARM-TF and new ARM-TF\\n     difference; later wrote a patch to disable MCU, secondary cores\\n     booting, PSCI_CPU_SUSPEND flow in exception entry.\\n     Unfortunately, the work cannot root cause the issue, hope this\\n     can help to narrow down it.\\n   - Supported ARM power team for mainline kernel enabling on\\n     Hikey960; Supported Google/John for 4.14 kernel PM patches\\n     porting and verification; Supported Sumit for Debian/boot images\\n     building; Changed partition table to support Debian/Android in\\n     the meantime\\n   - ARM power team reported CPUFreq driver regression, worked out one\\n     temporary patch for tweaking mailbox driver state machine.  Seems\\n     it's stable now and will check with Hisilicon for reliable\\n     fixing.\\n   - Tested Hikey MMC regression patch from John Stultz.\\n   - Re-spined power management enabling patch series v2, and merged\\n     into ARM-SoC tree.\\n   - Have a meeting with Hisilicon for display offset issue debugging,\\n     Hisilicon engineer gave several debugging registers dumping for\\n     DSI and HDMI clock setting.  Haojian now is working for dumping\\n     related registers.\\n   - Built latest Android image and 4.9 kernel for Hikey620 and\\n     followed Hisilicon suggestion to dump DSI and HDMI clock settings\\n     during initialization phase, also tried ADV7533 self-test mode\\n     with color bar and it didn't have offset issue.\\n   - Consolidated with Haojian's register dumping and shared related\\n     info with Hisilicon but so far didn't get feedback.\\n   - Answered questions from Juri for Hikey960 CPUFreq questions due\\n     Juri found the deadline task missing high percentage issue on\\n     Hikey960.\\n   - Answered questions from Valentin for dhrystone testing result\\n     bounce on Hikey960; shared him  my old testing ipython script.\\n   - Had a conference with Joyce and Hisilicon for thermal issue on\\n     Hikey960. Hisilicon power team committed sharing updated firmware\\n     in the early of September.\\n   - Reviewed Daniel Lezcano patch series for creating an instance for\\n     every Hikey/Hikey960 thermal sensor.\\n   - Shared the images (AOSP and boot images) and building with\\n     Hisilicon engineer  (Lv Da) for reproducing HDMI horizontal\\n     offset issue.\\n   - Reported the HDMI issue by Wei Yu (Power team assignee), HDMI\\n     cannot display properly on Hikey960 with kernel 4.14 on AOSP.\\n     Reproduced this issue at my side and filed a bug in the tracking\\n     system, exchanged info with John and verified the related patches\\n     worked out by John.  One issue for CMA region confliction with\\n     UEFI has been fixed, but still has not root caused for HDMI\\n     displaying issue; will continue related debugging with John.\\n   - Verified the patches and MCU firmware binary which shared by\\n     Kevin Wang; the MCU firmware has been merged into UEFI repo, will\\n     update patch for addressing John's comment.\\n   - According to Jonh Stultz comments, committed 3 new versions for\\n     Hisilicon trim patch;\\n   - Co-worked with John to narrow down kernel HDMI display issue with\\n     kernel 4.14; root caused that now kernel 4.14 and kernel 4.9\\n     cannot share the same userland android images;\\n   - John suggested to enable CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION so can run\\n     4.14 kernel images with old AOSP images, but this doesn't work as\\n     expected, shared dmesg and logcat with John.\\n   - Minor support for Jumana for sensor hub and Wei for mmc workqueue\\n     tasks.\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Poplar/Aspen maintainance [Daniel] (PSE-130)\\n   - Revived and polished my old Debian-on-a-stick proof-of-concept\\n     and extend it to become a full installer.\\n   - Shared with Aspen team and also on the forum (users are also\\n     having problems with the official installer)\\n   - Updated to \\\"latest\\\" v4.4 kernel release\\n   - Found and fixed problem with networking (disable\\n     ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORKING)\\n   - Re-spun poplar-usbstick with new kernel\\n   - Re-generated poplar-usbstick installer using v4.9 kernel\\n   - Testing I2C behaviour\\n\\n * Hisilicon: Poplar: OP-TEE port for Poplar board [Victor] (PSE-137)\\n   - meeting with Hisi to discuss arm-tf bl32 support, optee_os memory\\n     map and space in fip.bin for optee_os binary\\n   - board bringup\\n   - built sfdisk 2.26.2 from source to work around sfdisk 2.20.1\\n     error on ubuntu 14.04\\n   - setup local network for board tftp upgrade\\n   - understanding purpose of fastboot.bin in recovery process\\n   - started op-tee port\\n   - asking questions about and understanding arm-tf poplar_layout.h,\\n     in search for space for op-tee\\n   - checking arm-tf code for space for op-tee\\n   - setting up optee_os memory map\\n   - adjusting memory map per hisi comments\\n   - hunting down load addresses of u-boot and kernel\\n   - reviewing recovery build script\\n   - understanding l-loader and boot flow\\n   - pushing driver patches to poplar kernel 4.4 n 4.9\\n   - writing arm-tf code to support bl32\\n   - can now boot a fip that contains an op-tee binary, but kernel\\n     boot hangs\\n   - added partial build capability to build script\\n   - troubleshooting kernel boot hang\\n   - had placed op-tee at the top of 2gb ram but later found out that\\n     the board is 1gb so move it down to the 1gb border but that\\n     didn't help\\n   - enabled debug messages and saw op-tee driver not getting response\\n     on probe smc call so something must be overwriting some bl* area\\n   - memory reservation in u-boot and DT also didn't help\\n   - tested with various build configs which didn't help either\\n   - ended up increasing kernel_text_offset in u-boot and placing op-\\n     tee binary below it, which is essentially just another memory\\n     reservation, but it works so now we have a very basic port up and\\n     running\\n   - thanks to *Leo*, Dan, Jorge, Alex and Peter for help!\\n   - kernel hang issue writeup\\n   - finished testing remaining features (SDP, crypto extensions,\\n     shared memory, 4.4 kernel, 4.9 kernel, etc)\\n   - cleaning up code\\n   - some build script improvements\\n   - cleaning up and sending out patches\\n   - addressing patch review comments\\n   - removed swg ion patches from 4.9 kernel\\n   - test segfault reported by Shawn\\n   - need optee_os build option to specify dram size of 1 or 2 gb.\\n     Previously, dram size was set to 1gb but xtest can pass in\\n     addresses higher than that on a 2gb board and trigger a fault\\n     since they're not mapped in optee_os.\\n   - porting unmapped ION heap onto Hisi ion driver and testing\\n   - researching Hisi's claim that load addr conflicts with TA virtual\\n     mem space\\n   - testing 32b/aarch32 optee_os builds - boot hang\\n   - preparing and testing op-tee deb pkgs and instructions for pre-\\n     merge validation\\n   - researching bootrom's image (l-loader.bin) load size limitation\\n   - researching ways to let bootrom load bl1 only, and let bl1 load\\n     fip.bin\\n   - moving fip.bin to the end of l-loader.bin to avoid size check\\n   - reading related arm-tf code\\n   - discussion with Alex and Dan\\n   - researching Hisi's claim that load addr conflicts with TA virtual\\n     mem space\\n   - moving everything, including arm-tf, up 32mb and testing, but 32b\\n     optee_os build still boot hangs\\n   - arm-tf is setting spsr with SPSR_64 instead of SPSR_MODE32.

Patchset now has the required Acked-\\n     by:s and should be in the arm64 tree soon.\\n   - Generalized code to switch between NMI and normal interrupt\\n     handling on ARMv8 (having finally come up with an elegant way to\\n     do it). Almost, but not quite, back to working at this point.\\n   - Lots of small improvements to the patch series. Nearly ready for\\n     another round of review on LKML.\\n   - Finished generalizing code to choose between NMI and normal IRQ\\n     handling. Removes the last obvious hack from the code case!\\n   - Took interim (pre 4.3-rc1) kernel and merged existing working on\\n     top it it.\\n   - Adopted new code (from Russell King) to implement\\n     arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace().\\n   - Restructured patch series to get each patch focused on a single\\n     topic.\\n   - Updated notes on booting on FVP after re-arrangement of member\\n     builds by ARM LT. New firmware builds look much better than\\n     previous ones (no silly inverse video messages, no clear screen\\n     during boot to hide boot messages).\\n   - Found and fixed an incompatibility between CONFIG_LOCKDEP and the\\n     pseudo-NMI work on ARM64. The lockdep callbacks run in a peculiar\\n     calling context, with the NMI is masked but with the kernel not\\n     yet informed it is handling an interrupt, so we need extra state\\n     tracking to prevent the self-consistanch checks from firing.\\n   - Converted RFC v2 review feedback into TODO list and started\\n     acting in it.\\n   - Modified apply_alternatives_early() to consider only capabilities\\n     that can safely be detected before other processors boot (i.e.\\n     detect the presence/absence of a GICv3).\\n   - Ran lmbench with and without changes on a GICv2 platform (HiKey).\\n     Getting lmbench running well under buildroot was time consuming\\n     (I have notes to avoid spending this time in future).\\n   - Pinged the Hisilicon LT to determine whether D02 is a suitable\\n     test platform for GICv3 features.\\n   - Completed some simple micro-benchmarks\\n   - Reviewed DTS files for HiSilicon D02 boards. It is a good test\\n     platform for benchmarking the cost of the pseudo-NMI support\\n     (Cortex A57s paired with GICv3)\\n   - Received access to the boards via open-estuary lab and\\n     successfully ran the vendor kernel\\n   - Started trying to figure out best kernel version to use to\\n     perform testing (vendor 4.1 + backport or mainline 4.3 + patchset\\n     + board support).\\n   - Rebased on v4.4-rc1 kernel. Mostly this was adapting to the\\n     significantly reworked CPU feature detection code in the 4.4\\n     series.\\n   - Added a patch (which I will probably not publish) to allow the\\n     kernel to work on a GICv3 system *without* deploying any runtime\\n     patching; this is controlled by command line options. This allows\\n     us to eliminate cache effects from side-by-side benchmarking of\\n     the two interrupt masking mechanisms.\\n   - Ran micro benchmarks on Hisilicon D02 platform. Initial results\\n     look very promising (PMR masking may even have better\\n     performance).\\n   - Adding debug information to try and determine why NMI does not\\n     pre-empt on real silicion (when it does on simulator). Results\\n     are inconclusive.\\n   - Rebased arm (32-bit) work to latest kernel. Integration between\\n     irqchip/gic and arch/arm is finally starting to feel more elegant\\n     (yay).\\n   - Found a fault in the ARM \\\"NMI\\\" backtrace code (from Russell King)\\n     and proposed a fix on LKML.\\n   - Marc Zyngier proposed an alternative fix and posted to ML. I have\\n     tested this and it is a good fix.\\n   - Replied and reacted to problems reported by the 0-day builder on\\n     the arch/arm patches.\\n   - Rebased to v4.5 (was v4.4-rc5)\\n   - Code no longer works after rebase; starting to debug\\n   - Merged into v4.6-rc3 (last working version is v4.4). Code is\\n     *completely* non functional after merge, does not even have an\\n     serial traces.\\n   - Started to bisect the various patches; predictably it is the big\\n     patch (the one that makes huge changes to how interrupts are\\n     actually masked) that causes the problem.\\n   - Hacking the feature detection to allow me to flick the\\n     enable/disable from kernel command line\\n   - Finally figured out why the code was dead when merged into v4.6.\\n     This kernel changed the organisation of sections within one of\\n     the assembler files, preventing (through segv) dynamic patching\\n     of code that previously could be patched OK. Fixed by rearranging\\n     some of the new code.\\n   - Still not working perfectly on v4.6 (pre-emption is not happening\\n     as it should).\\n   - Problems also observed when switching to a newer FVP. Best guess\\n     is that this is because new FVP supports virtualization\\n     extensions.\\n   - Bisected between v4.5 and v4.6 (with help fromgit rerere to\\n     handle the repeated merges) to figure out what causes NMIs to\\n     stop functioning correctly.\\n   - Turned out to be an fairly innoccent looking patch to add support\\n     for multi-core ACPI platforms without PSCI... which caused me to\\n     place the NMI on SGI7 rather than SGI6.\\n   - It looks like SGI7 does not work correctly on FVP; for now I've\\n     kept using SGI6 (but will need to investigate further later)\\n   - Did experimental merge with pre-v4.7-rc1 and discovered problems\\n     with interleaving of output from different CPUs\\n   - Rebased on v4.7-rc3\\n   - Solved interleaving issue in the output during NMI (turned out to\\n     be a KConfig problem)\\n   - Looked up all pending feedback on the 32-bit ARM code to trigger\\n     backtrace using FIQ\\n   - Started updating code to honour the review comments.\\n   - Responded to a community request asking which of my patches\\n     remain relevant on the latest kernels (Lucas Stach, Pengutronix).\\n   - Completed acting on code review of 32-bit code base.\\n   - Tested on a bunch of platforms (3 physical, 2 qemu).\\n   - Posted to LKML\\n   - Rebased 32-bit arm code base on v4.8-rc1, fixed resulting bugs\\n     and posted to LKML.\\n   - Rebased arm64 code base on v4.8-rc1 and tested (result was pass).\\n   - Updated LMG on status.\\n   - Replied to a query from Arnd about impact of my work on\\n     set_fiq_handler() (current implementation of set_fiq_handler()\\n     prevents some useful read-only pages pages from being ported to\\n     arm).\\n   - Fixed bug in arm64 code base [I forgot to update the\\n     interrupts_enabled(struct pt_regs *) predicate.\\n   - Finalized pseudo-NMI backtrace implementation for arm64.\\n   - Posted to LKML\\n   - Updated to a later version of the FVP firmware from ARM LT (now\\n     using u-boot instead of UEFI).\\n   - arm64 RFC attracted some great review comments form Marc Zygnier\\n     (ARM). In particular Marc requested a simplification in the way\\n     we mask interrupts before we fetch from the interrupt acknowledge\\n     register.\\n   - Started making the changes Marc requested.\\n   - Rebased on v4.9-rc4\\n   - Started trying to tackle that \\\"final\\\" technical problem (problems\\n     running on latest version of the FVP)\\n   - Posted Developerbox kernel benchmark results of Julian's v4 to\\n     kernel ML (enabling pseudo-NMI reduce performance somewhere\\n     between 0.2% and 0.5%).\\n\\n * Linaro: Fully exercise HiKey or DragonBoard LS connector [Victor]\\n   (PSE-70)\\n   - Wrote guide for hooking up SPI ethernet dongle on db410c\\n   - Addressed review comments for guide on hooking up SPI ethernet\\n     dongle on db410c.

PSCI needs to be\\ncovered in detail, cpuidle, cpufreq. Reuse is possible although focus is\\ndifferent (no need to focus on upstreaming).\\n@leoy recommends adding further slides about A-T-F (since that is where\\nPSCI lives). Makes a much more complete presentation.\\n\\\"I have the confidence I can finish in one/two weeks\\\" (two weeks if we\\ninclude A-T-F\\\").\\n\\nLeo can redeliver training internally (so @yfw, @danielt, @paulliu).\\nThat would be great.\\n\\n### PS-25: MTK training\\n\\nLots of slides. Need to spend some time working through the presentation\\nand reduce the number of slide (to focus presentation).\\n\\n@danielt is rather behind on work for PS-25. Will focus on this for\\nremainder of this week (esp. Thursday).\\n\\n@danielt needs to spend more time reviewing existing slides.\\n\\n### HiKey\\n\\nSmall support activities on pinctrl and thermal.\\n\\nShared patches to make thermal throttling more aggressive (i.e. to harm\\nperformance).\\n\\nSome fixes required to UART downloader tool (to remove spurious error\\nreports). Likely to be fixed by end of week.\\n\\nNote: Written by taking reference code for different SoC and preparing\\n      it for HiKey.\\n\\n## paulliu\\n\\ndanielt\\tIndeed.

Or maybe you have many things to ask?\\ndanielt\\tA few... not too much.\\npaulliu\\tI think you maybe have a lot. \\nBecause yesterday's meeting is a bit strange.\\nNow they ask us to do Debian.\\ndanielt\\tI certainly wanted to cover that.\\npaulliu\\tI'm ok to do Debian because I'm very familiar with that.\\nBut I think the major reason Taiten didn't mentioned is about the Android acceleration.\\nGFX acceleration. I'm asking if I can directly use the binary blobs.\\ndanielt\\tAs my e-mail, the choice of OS is up to Actions.\\nLike you I'm happier if they go with Debian than Android.\\npaulliu\\tOK.\\nBut isn't it a required to have an android image for 96boards? No?\\ndanielt\\tDraft compliance docs list minimum of one OS from approved list.\\npaulliu\\tOK.\\ndanielt\\tDebian (and Android, Fedora, OE) is on the list.\\nSo...\\nYou think they did this to avoid having to re-accelerate GFX?\\n(on Android)\\npaulliu\\tI've ask. They not only use the binary blobs for GFX, but they also change the AOSP framework for that. Their engineer have confirmed this so if they give us the binary blob, it just won't applied to AOSP/LCR.\\ndanielt\\tI see.\\npaulliu\\tFor example, they even change the OpenMAX stack to do some acceleration.\\nAnd they dislike to share it.\\nFor Video acceleration.\\nSo their idea is simple, they have a very good Android, and they don't have a good Debian, so if we can do Debian for them, they got both.\\ndanielt\\tThey do recognise \\\"we\\\" means \\\"you\\\" do they ;-)\\npaulliu\\tIf it is ok to us, then let's just do it.\\nYes, that's it.\\ndanielt\\tThe other thing that concerned me in Taiten's mail was: \\\"If not, please add this to the scope of work for Bubblegum-96\\\"\\npaulliu\\tSo I'll make Debian for them for the 64-bit version.\\ndanielt\\t(here he was describing SD recovery image)\\npaulliu\\tYes..\\ndanielt\\tIt made it sound like we have a big team of engineers ready to do stuff...\\n... if that wasn't intentional then this is fine.\\nCan you tell me more about recovery image?\\nNot clear why not just provide user instructions to launch \\\"dd\\\"\\npaulliu\\tI won't call it a recovery image. It is a installer image. What they want is a SDCard, insert to their board, and then the SDCard install Linux to eMMC.\\nAutomatically.\\nSomething like we install Ubuntu by inserting a USB stick.\\nSo I'll call it a installer.\\ndanielt\\tOk... but what is it for?\\nTo make board feel like PC?\\npaulliu\\tSo their hardware is a bit powerful on GFX. What I saw yesterday is it really looks like PC.\\nOpenGL support. Not GLES.\\nAnd glmark2 runs good with binary blobs.\\ndanielt\\tThat's sounds good.\\npaulliu\\tSo I think they want to make PC, so they need a install CD.\\nSomething like that.\\ndanielt\\tHmnnn...\\nI can't think of another embedded board that works like that.\\npaulliu\\tI know I can make a image with init script that do the dd stuff at beginning..\\ndanielt\\tSome of the Qualcomm boards use SD for de-brick.\\nHowever AFAIK that's just a boot script that launches dd automatically.\\npaulliu\\tyes. \\nThey are asking us if we can do that or not. And Taiten think it is quite reasonable to have one.\\ndanielt\\tTo be it feels like a maintenance/testing burden that adds little value.\\nTechnically not too hard but its a different rootfs to test each time.\\nAre you keen to do it?\\npaulliu\\tWhat do you mean \\\"keen\\\" to do it?\\nI can do a hacky version that just dd somewhere after boot to Linux. But as you said, it's another rootfs.\\ndanielt\\tMostly do you believe its useful?\\npaulliu\\tMight be useful when they pack the board as a PC. But otherwise, for community development, I don't think it is useful.\\nWhat I remember is EfikaMX also doing the same thing at beginning.\\nBut later they use Linaro way. Just dd.\\ndanielt\\tPerhaps we look at this a different way...\\npaulliu\\tEfikaMX is a laptop. So they did have a installer SD card at very beginning.\\ndanielt\\tLets look at the PC use-case a different way. If they get the firmware \\\"right\\\" then they can directly boot Debian install media.\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\ndanielt\\tA-T-F + UEFI?\\npaulliu\\tYes. That's it.\\nIf they use UEFI, they can run Debian installer image.\\nBut they don't. So this is basically an ancient workaround. Use a SDCard recovery image.\\ndanielt thinks about problems of hardware support\\ndanielt\\tWithout upstream eMMC (and SD) support then debian installer won't actually boot...\\npaulliu\\tAnd actually I also ask this yesterday. They boot preference is eMMC, then SD card.\\nIf eMMC rootfs crash, they have a hardware switch to destroy eMMC.\\ndanielt\\tIn near term would probably have to generate custom images to get hardware support in kernel (and to get non-debian packages for kernel and GFX\\npaulliu\\tAnd then the BROM will choose SDcard so SDCard can re-install eMMC.\\nThat's the current design.\\ndanielt\\tSounds fairly sensible... odd that the boot switch reformats eMMC though... normally it just makes it boot from somewhere else and leaves reformat to software.\\npaulliu\\tYes, I'll have to grab them and their GFX provider to make a Debian package for GFX.\\ndanielt\\tCan you explore this more next week with Actions?\\npaulliu\\tYou mean the reformat eMMC stuff?\\ndanielt\\tBasically for de-brick I'd recommend just using the default image burnt to SD card (with instructions on how to reprogram eMMC from command line)\\nFor PC-like usability we should think about UEFI boot and (in short term) custom installer images to supply new kernel and GFX .deb .\\nEventually upstream h/ware enablement should mean custom installer can be dropped (and OpenGL .deb fetched after install).\\nActions might push back on this but it seems closest to the \\\"right thing\\\" which is always a good starting point for negotiation.\\npaulliu\\tOK. Got it.\\ndanielt\\tAnd you are \\\"happy\\\" with above approach?\\npaulliu\\tSure. That's the *right* way to do.\\nBut considering the time or cost, we sometimes choose another way.\\ndanielt\\tGreat (I don't mind taking low cost route but like it to be recognised as such)\\npaulliu\\tBut I'd like to do the right thing, or at least, discuss with them at least.\\ndanielt\\tOk... so last think for me a LAVAish.\\nTyler Baker mentioned it is a pain when PMIC comes up with device in off state (i.e. like Android device waiting for soft power button to wake main SoC)\\nHiKey has a jumper to make PMIC automatically power on SoC when barrel jack is connected.\\nDo you know if Bubblegum-96 has anything similar?\\npaulliu\\tYou mean we have to have a way to control its power?\\nNot in my mind yet but I can figure that out with Actions next week.\\ndanielt\\tIt should be handled (because its a h/ware certification requirement) but I'd like to know whether its a jumper of a software mode.\\npaulliu\\tWhat I remember is when we do Freescale, we did ask them to modify the board so we can control the power by some GPIO stuff. So Lava Board is a tweaked one that can control power by one of the GPIO pin.\\ndanielt\\tEven that isn't ideal...\\nFor simplest LAVA integration we want the DC jack to be switched.\\nNo paracitic power from USB... no wiggling of GPIO lines to get SoC to enter bootloader...\\n(96Boards mandates both of these but doesn't specify how second of these is realized...)\\npaulliu\\tNeed to ask. \\ndanielt\\tOk... it might also be obvious to you when they send you a board.\\npaulliu\\tFor their s500 board, (not in our scope for lava). I can say it might be more complicated.\\ndanielt\\tYes... and might mean they've not thought enough about it.\\n(but hopefully they have)\\npaulliu\\tBecause you cannot connect serial port first. Otherwise it enters to a strange state. Won't start at all when powered.\\nThe serial port small power make the board to a strange state.\\ndanielt\\tIts a very common problem. It makes lab hardware very complex (because you need a relay on all connectors that can paracitically power the SoC).\\npaulliu\\tYes.\\nSo we are not controlling it outside? I mean make another hardware?\\ndanielt\\tSingle relay on DC and fastboot/TFTP-via-ethernet results in really quick LAVA enablement.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\t(although LAVA guys are busy so don't always define \\\"quick\\\" the same way a member does)\\n:-)\\nAnything else for this week?\\npaulliu\\tNo from me.\\ndanielt\\tAnd from me there is only an apology for not looking much at the BSP split apart...\\nI hope to get to it late this week (maybe early next). I have to get some slide writing finishe first.\\npaulliu\\tOK. But doesn't matter right now. They are still tweaking the u-boot.\\ndanielt\\tThat's good. I hate being the bottleneck...\\npaulliu\\tI'll doing a little bit s500 first. To make some integration of their binary blob (opengl).\\nTo Debian.\\ndanielt\\tCurious... isn't S500 a MALI?\\npaulliu\\tNo..\\ndanielt\\tOk... that was easy!\\npaulliu\\tIt is a 25% speed of the same thing that s900 has.\\ndanielt\\tWow!\\nTell me... are we expecting S900 to struggle for thermal headroom?\\npaulliu\\tMaybe. \\ndanielt\\tHiKey is going though 24hr reliability testing right now and we are seeing problems with thermal mgt.\\npaulliu\\tI do believe we can play openarena on it.\\ndanielt\\tYay!\\npaulliu\\tAnd it will be very hot.\\ndanielt\\tPS You are welcome to talk in general terms about 24hr soak tests but don't mention HiKey explicitly.\\npaulliu\\tok.\\ndanielt\\tIn that case I think we are done.\\npaulliu\\tyeah.\\ndanielt\\tSee you next week!\\npaulliu\\tthanks. see you.\\n\\n## 1:1 scottb/jbates\\n\\n### Positioning\\n\\n1 calender month \\\"buddy\\\" programme?

When the system is fully loaded with all threads we\\nneed to schedule based on policy.\\n\\n * Currently the switch to performance mode is conservative\\n * When a single CPU saturates this indicates we are at tipping point\\n   and need to switch to priority aware scheduling.\\n   - Saturated means ~80% load according to PELT\\n * Q: Do affined tasks contribute to tipping point? Yes - bind to\\n   little core and it can cause EAS to cross the tipping point\\n * Q: How long does it take for the (damped) metrics to conclude\\n   the task is CPU bound? \\n   - ~75ms burst demand on LITTLE core will cause us to enter the\\n    CFS (spray across all cores) mode.\\n\\nWARNING: Above is current status... problems will be solved over time.\\n\\n## PELT\\n\\nQ: Is 32ms too long for mobile?\\n\\n * Possibly... qualcomm (Steve Muckle) are investigating what happens\\n   when we use alternative maths and faster periods\\n * Need techniques to boost performance when touching the glass\\n   - schedtune, sched-dvfs, ?force tipping point?\\n\\n# Reality check\\n\\nQ: So EAS will give me the \\\"best\\\" energy and performance?\\nA: If there is a spare capacity EAS will be doing its best. If there is \\nno spare capacity we will act the same as mainline.\\n\\nQ: EAS and IPA in the same system?\\nA: \\\"It is known to work\\\" partly because EAS gets out of the way when a\\n   CPU is compute bound due to the tipping point.\\n   \\n   EAS is aware that IPA has throttled but there is no other coupling\\n   between the two systems. Under extreme throttling EAS (and CFS) will \\n   favour the LITTLE core \\n\\n# Decomposable energy model\\n\\nFirst core is most expensive to turn on due to cluster costs. Have a\\nper-cluster table and a per-core table.\\n\\nCan't *model* shared voltage regulators because there is rarely if ever\\nany value in over-volting the second cluster. It is better to finish work\\nquicker and sleep (this answer is good for both thermal and battery).\\n\\nQ: What is responsible for binding the cluster CPU frequencies to\\n   avoid over-volting?\\n\\nA: Simplest solution is to have single clock domain... even if there is\\n   a separate divider it is better no to use it.\\n\\n# DVFS in Linux\\n\\nCurrent sampling based governors are too slow to respond. We are \\\"late\\\"\\nkicking up the frequency (missing performance target). This can be a\\n*bigger* problem for tasks with deadlines (such as vsync reaction) if\\nthe sampling period means tasks that miss the next vsync falsely appear\\nto have lower load.\\n\\nIf scheduler can estimate load of CPU we can spin up the CPUs \\nproactively based on past task behaviour.\\n\\nWithout deadline scheduling this will always be a problem (PELT is 32ms,\\nVsync is 16.66ms). May encourage a Vsync paced task to falsely slot into\\nlow load when it misses deadlines.\\n\\n# EAS components\\n\\nIn the mainline focused patchset there is not code to cause CPU bound\\ntasks running on LITTLE core to migrate to the big core. This *is* code\\nto shift tasks on wakeup but not for a currently running task.\\n\\nThere is code in the \\\"plus set\\\" patches to solve this but it is not a\\ngeneric \\\"upstream friendly\\\" solution.\\n\\nCurrently there are no DT bindings because its been difficult to have\\nsimultaneous discussions with multiple tribes of maintainer. DT bindings\\nare currently being looked at more closely. There are some difficult\\nquesitons here about how to express compacity. Need \\\"facts\\\" not ratios.\\nFor example: dhrystone MIPS per MHz is a micro-architectural fact about\\none CPU (that is not memory bound). This is a good way to describe \\nperformance.\\n\\n# Schedtune\\n\\nAttempting to consolidate tuneables... goal is the single global\\ntuneable.\\n\\nCurrently have \\\"boost\\\" tuneable which can be set both globally and\\nper-cgroup which inflates the load tracking data by a margin. The extra \\nmargin create by the boost encourages promotion to bigger cores.\\n\\nSchedtune is built in top of EAS and schedfreq (it's boost works\\nby biasing their decision making processes).\\n\\n## What does it mean to boost performance?\\n\\nSpeed up time-to-completion either by increasing CPU frequency or\\nmigrating to a more powerful core.\\n\\nNeeds:\\n\\n * Strategy to apply boost\\n * Means to bias CPU selection choice\\n * Means to bias OPP selection choice\\n\\n## The tuneable\\n\\n0%   -> min energy consumption\\n100% -> run at max freq (and big core) all the time\\n50%  -> something \\\"exactly\\\" in the middle\\n\\n## Boost approaches\\n\\nSignal Proportional Compensation: 30% means study the distance to max\\ncapacity and boost PELT by 30% of the delta to max capacity. Normally\\nworks with constant 1024 for max capacity (i.e. capacity of most \\npowerful CPU in the system).\\n\\nBoost signals are *not* used to control the EAS trip point. So\\nregardless of the boosts applies, EAS will determine whether to trip\\nbased on the *real* PELT values.\\n\\n## Biasing OPP\\n\\nWhen schedfreq selects CPUfreq it will use boosted values. This means\\ntasks boosted at 100% will always run at maximum frequency.\\n\\n## Biasing CPU migration\\n\\nWhen EAS makes a task placement decision it will use the boosted \\nvalues. Tasks boosted at 100% will \\\"like\\\" big cores (if they have\\ncapacity for it).\\n\\nHowever it does *not* use the boosted values for other tasks on the \\nCPU (i.e. when making a placement decision we compare boosted task\\nutilization to *actual* CPU utilization).\\n\\nNote: This creates a problem for 100% boost. Such a task can only \\never fit on an idle big core. At present if we cannot find this we will \\ngive up on placement and leave the task on the CPU it ran on most \\nrecently.\\n\\n## Boost when touching the glass\\n\\ncgroup selection and boosting...\\n\\nThere are a static number of boost groups. Once exhausted no new cgroups\\ncan join any but the default boost groups.\\n\\nBelieve 4 boost groups are sufficient.\\n\\n\\n# \\\"The future\\\"\\n\\nPartners tend to ask questions about sophisticated/wacko scheduling\\nfeatures.\\n\\n * Interactive response\\n   - Is a gap for productization (compared with interactive governor for\\n     example.\\n\\n * Micro-architecture delta is a fixed constant (1.6x for A53/A57).\\n   Could use PMU to derived per-task coefficient... but what is benefit\\n   and what is cost.\\n\\n * Clusters that share a voltage regulator\\n\\n * Not yet attempted to tune EAS on a system with per-core DVFS\\n\\n * Advanced performance control\\n   - Try to understand system events such as Vsync\\n\\n * Full NO_HZ is incompatible with EAS. Will not enter the scheduler\\n   so tasks on the CPU will not get updated during scheduler tick.\\n   - No KConfig for EAS so not possiblity to \\\"protect\\\" user from this.\\n   - NO_HZ idle (disable tick only for idle cores) is tolerated (it is \\n     technically broken but problems can be exposed with synthetic \\n     examples)\\n\\nAn interesting question is: Do modern PC laptop chipsets allow per-core \\nvoltage and frequency scaling?

This is a real asset that should provide good confidence \\nfor early upstreaming effort.\\n\\nThat said, *all* patches must be passed through checkpatch.pl before\\nposting to mailing lists and should also be subject to a more detailed\\nline by line review. To emphasis this, once backports and third-party \\ncode is removed, there at 52 patches of which only 3 pass cleanly \\nthrough the latest version of checkpatch.pl. Even if we hack\\ncheckpatch.pl to exclude warnings about the missing device tree\\ndocumentation it this only rises to 7.\\n\\nNote: When patches are sent to the mailing list and reviewers are\\n      forced to comment on trivial matters they will be too distracted\\n      by this to make more substantive (and useful) review comments. \\n      For that reason all patches on the mailing list should pay full\\n      attention to stylistic matters, even for an RFC or v1 patches.\\n      Linaro may be able to help to pre-review some of the initial\\n      patches as part of a confidence building exercise.\\n\\nDespite the overall good impression there are a few drivers that may\\nrequire significant refactoring or from-scratch rewrites to become\\nsuitable for upstreaming. Sadly this includes both MMC/SD and USB\\nleaving us without good drivers to provide root filesystem and\\nnetworking support.\\n\\nOther difficult points for upstreaming include:\\n\\n 1. The structure of the PMIC driver family. The PMIC code is\\n    generally well written (although there is some dead code\\n    to remove) but it is likely that maintainers will challenge\\n    the way it is partitioned.\\n\\n 2. The library code in driver/soc/ must be carefully reviewed to see\\n    if there is a better home for some or all of it.\\n\\n 3. The display stack is Android centric (based on ADF) and cannot\\n    be upstreamed without a rewrite.\\n\\nRecommended next steps for upstreaming:\\n\\n 1. Starting from a clean upstream kernel forward port the minimal\\n    drivers required to allow the platform to boot and mount a\\n    root filesystem from an initramfs. It is important the initial\\n    sub-set is as small as possible because this work can be hard\\n    to do in parallel.\\n\\n 2. Choose one of the USB controllers and forward port and clean\\n    up its driver. The dwc3 based controllers look best suited for this\\n    because there is less new code required.\\n    \\n    USB provides the initial networking and block device support\\n    needed to run standard distros. Having access to a full distro\\n    package repository makes testing other drivers much easier!\\n\\n 3. Form a strategy for an upstreamable MMC driver: is it best to\\n    rewrite from scratch or to strip out the difficult features?\\n    Deliver a new MMC driver accordingly.\\n\\n 4. Remaining upstreaming can be tackled in parallel and should\\n    mostly be done in quality order (i.e. gain confidence upstreaming\\n    before tackling the difficult subjects).\\n\\nRecommended next steps for (Linaro managed) 96Boards kernel:\\n\\nThe ideal 96Boards kernel strategy is sufficiently similar to the\\nabove upstreaming strategy that the work could be piggy backed on\\ntop of the above upstream work.\\n\\nIn particular, it is far better to start from a clean kernel and\\nperform gradual hardware enablement within that clean tree than\\nis is to try and massage an existing vendor tree until a merge \\nbecomes possible (because the day the merge can happen may never \\nbe reached). That means the output of 1, 2 and 3 above are all \\nideal candidates for backporting to a 96Boards kernel. Having \\nupstream quality foundations for the kernel is a real asset for further \\nwork upon it.\\n\\nThe only major difference for the 96Boards kernel is that there is\\nscope, for pragmatic reasons, to accept code into drivers/staging\\nthat would be unlikely to be accepted upstream. This allows\\ndifficult but vital hardware, perhaps display and SDIO, to be\\nenabled while deferring the significant re-engineering effort\\nrequired to upstream them.\\n\\nNote that acceptance of code known to be unacceptable upstream will\\nbe reluctant and by negotiation only. Make sure any drivers you\\nbelieve must be tackled, or any other pragmatic trade offs that\\nwould be useful, are discussed during any statement-of-work\\ndiscussions.\\n\\n--- cut here ---\\n\\ngit format-patch \\\\\\n\\t--subject-prefix=\\\"PATCH\\\" \\\\\\n\\t--cover-letter --find-renames -92\\n\\nv1: <not-yet-released>\\n\" }\n",
